<description>Kyla will be looking for a new ride soon and she has her sights set on an odd class of vehicle that includes the Geo Tracker and the Suzuki Sidekick, which were supposed to look like off-road vehicles. Well, they got the &apos;off-road&apos; part sort of right: they never should have been allowed on roads of any kind. But it will take some careful persuasion to talk Kyla out of this potential purchase. That, a new puzzler and more calls on this episode of the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Every car repair shop has that old, grizzled mechanic who&apos;s willing to be strapped to the hood of a moving car in order to listen for a noise, or to hold two wires together with his bare hands in order to check for high voltage current. At Car Talk, that mechanic was Krusty. Krusty could not only tell you -with a taste off his fingertip- whether that oil stain was 30 or 40-weight , but he could do it while wafting tailpipe smoke into his mouth as a way of double checking the shop&apos;s exhaust gas analyzer. The legend that was Krusty was a feature of the puzzler for decades and here is one of his early mentions.</description>

<description>The Puzzler usually goes off the rails when the brothers&apos; grasp of the concept is &apos;imperfect&apos;, shall we say. This time it&apos;s the demonstration of the concept that almost gets them in trouble. Good thing they have &apos;faces made for radio&apos; or the FCC would be all over them.

Is it really necessary in the middle of a New York winter to wash your car when it will be just as dirty within a few days? As luck would have it, the brothers disagree with both choices.

<description>Donna&apos;s Pontiac is giving her problems. Instead of being the prototypical &apos;Donna Pontiac&apos; of Car Talk lore -a Firebird, she&apos;s stuck with a lowly Pontiac 1000 -a Chevy Chevette in disguise. And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, her ignition key, of all things, is causing trouble. Can Tom and Ray talk Donna into trading-in this heap for a shiny new Firebird or will they come up with a fix for this &apos;starter Pontiac&apos;? Find out on this episode of the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>On a recent show the brothers flatly stated that no one ever gets cited for tailgating on the roads nowadays. Christopher, a humble student from St. Louis begs to differ. He was going down the road in his Peugeot when he got pulled over for following to close to the vehicle in front of him. Hear Chris tell the rest of his tailgating tale on this episode of the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Kevin&apos;s Pontiac is outfitted with an early version of a modern digital dashboard and it&apos;s giving him trouble. But his mechanic won&apos;t work on it because he&apos;s never worked on one before. Click and Clack, however, are firm believers in broadening one&apos;s knowledge base and expertise at the customer&apos;s expense and they find this mechanic&apos;s wimpiness professionally disappointing. Find out if Kevin and the rest of the callers get any qualified car advice on this episode of the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Robert from Los Angeles has just about had it with the traffic on his local, bumper-to-bumper, take-no-prisoners highway and he&apos;s begun jousting with aggressive tractor trailer drivers to vent his frustration. To put it mildly, the truckers aren&apos;t amused or intimidated by Robert in his Ford Escort and they are letting him know this in a road-ragey kind of way. Can Tom and Ray calm Robert down, or will he end up &apos;flattened on the 405&apos;? Also, a new puzzler and more calls right here on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Politicians aren&apos;t the only ones in DC that come in just two types. Allen from Washington, DC is facing a dilemma regarding his local mechanics and humbly asks the boys a very profound question: When faced with a mechanic who is either honest and incompetent or one who is competent but crooked, how do you choose? Fortunately(or unfortunately?), Allen has come to the leading authorities on automotive incompetency. That, plus more calls and a new puzzler on this episode of the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>In the wider world, &apos;a little R and R&apos;(rest and relaxation) is a good thing. But here at Car Talk Plaza, &apos;R and R&apos; stands for &apos;Rant and Rave&apos; and that means that it&apos;s time to duck and cover while Tommy holds court on one or more of his pet driving peeves. Today&apos;s target: inconsiderate younger drivers who don&apos;t yield right of way. And that&apos;s just the beginning. That, more calls and a new puzzler on this episode of the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Luis from Shreveport is having power problems with his Ford Escort. After they remind him that the Escort didn&apos;t have any power to begin with, the boys roll out two perfectly reasonable diagnoses. When Luis shoots down the first one, Tom and Ray cling desperately to the other -facts be damned. Did they get lucky or will Luis be forever pushing the Escort around Shreveport? This, more calls and a new puzzler on today&apos;s Best of Car Talk!</description>

<description>Having cemented their reputations as America&apos;s preeminent purveyors of questionable car advice, the brothers would occasionally get invited to do the show from some semi-exotic locale like Alaska, Hawaii or even Hoboken. This show has them visiting wonderful Walt Disney World. Between fixing the monorail, cutting the line to Space Mountain, taking some calls and trying to remember where they left their kids they conducted a little tour. What could go wrong? Plenty!</description>

<description>Donna is tired of boring cars so she just went out and bought herself a new Mazda Miata convertible. Donna&apos;s husband convinced her that the car&apos;s "break-in period" is critical to the long, trouble-free life of the car&apos;s engine, so he really should be driving it now as a &apos;favor&apos; to her. Yes, Donna&apos;s husband is a lout, but will Tom and Ray expose his ruse? Find out on today&apos;s Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Most of us have had the displeasure of walking up to our car to find an industrial-sized, avian ordinance splattered across the door handle and into places we&apos;ll never get it completely out of, but only a select few of us has asked, "Does it have to be so?"

<description>Katherine from Maine occasionally drives her Ford Festiva all the way to New Mexico for fun. The boys try to take her brake trouble seriously, nonetheless. Ditto Keith from Montana who swears that his Plymouth Horizon is trying to electrocute him, and Consuelo from Texas who wants us to believe that her Mercedes won&apos;t stay still after she parks it.

<description>Like a lot of middle-aged drivers, John from North Carolina wanted to cut loose and buy a cool car. But instead of reaching back to his youth for a 1960s muscle car he decided to settle for his idea of a contemporary mid-life crisis mobile: a Hyundai. How&apos;s that, John?

<description>Back &apos;in the day&apos; Click and Clack observed that there were many species of peculiar drivers around their &apos;fair city&apos;. Older men wearing hats were feared only slightly less than young women named Donna who zipped along in their Firebirds or Camaros without a care or a turn signal. Today the boys meet a conscientious, Datsun-driving ,Philadelphian Donna who is pretty sure that her mechanic is soaking her for a second round of major engine work. Can they talk her into junking this car in favor of the new Z28, or do they have a new subspecies of Donna on their hands?</description>

They also help Dayton fr AZ and Matt fr AL realize that speedometers and temperature gauges are helpful but hardly necessary auto accoutrements</description>

<description>As the boys near the date for their &apos;3rd Annual Car Talk Sock Hop&apos; Tamsen calls in from California with a VW Superbeetle that Shakes, Rattles and Rolls down the highway. Robin has a rotten exhaust, Debbie&apos;s Peugeot won&apos;t go, and Kirk wonders if the $19 alignments he&apos;s been getting regularly will eventually solve his Dodge&apos;s habit of heading for the ditch. All this and a new puzzler on today&apos;s show!</description>

<description>After several wives, Tommy came to the realization that within the spousal universe you can either be right or you can stay married. So when Warren fr IL called looking for help in settling a disagreement between him and his wife, the advice about the car was secondary to keeping the relationship in proper tune. That high-wire act, more calls and a new puzzler all on today&apos;s show.</description>

<description>Somewhere between &apos;Save the Whales&apos; and &apos;Save Our Planet&apos; Click and Clack took up the cause of the endangered North American Skeet. Contrary to popular opinion, it was the desperate plight of these poor creatures who are bred in captivity for the sole purpose of blowing them to smithereens with shotguns that &apos;pulled&apos; at Tom and Ray&apos;s heartstrings: Not the money-making potential to fleece unwitting listeners out of a few bucks. No, it definitely wasn&apos;t that. But just in case the SEC was listening the boys did take a few calls to keep up appearances.</description>

<description>Today&apos;s show starts out with a listener communique from the future spelling out Click and Clack&apos;s fate, and it ends with the boys repeating the words, &apos;Oinga, Boinga, Boinga&apos; like some lost explorers in an old B movie. In between, our time travelers help Dan with his foggy windshield, Nancy with her squeaky brakes and Rita with her soon to be ex&apos; questionable car advice. And of course, a new puzzler!</description>

Buddy walked off in the rain to the general store and came back with a miracle cure right off the shelf. Did it fix the problem? Or was the fix all-wet like Buddy?

This was one of those weeks. Together, the boys have better luck with Clayton&apos;s Jaguar noise, E.G.&apos;s self-steering Jeep and Ira&apos;s Acura.</description>

<description>Nothing succeeds like secession! Or at least that&apos;s the thinking as Tom and Ray plan for Car Talk Plaza&apos;s imminent secession(from what exactly, we&apos;re not sure). But the crazy car problems will of course emigrate to wherever they land. This week&apos;s beleagured citizens of Car-Talk-istan include John and his Chevy&apos;s &apos;woobie&apos;, Robin&apos;s stuck Rabbit and Mazz with her chirping transmission.

Now, why would they risk their good standing in the local mechanic&apos;s yachting club by turning down such potentially lucrative repairs? Could Ellen&apos;s starting problem or Tom&apos;s electrical issues be more labor-intensive goldmines? Doubt it. All this and a new puzzler, too!</description>

<description>Broadcasting again this time from their new think tank -The Bushings Institute, Tom and Ray advise Cynthia that the fate of her beloved 1980 Chevy Citation is inextricably linked up with her personal life choices. Jim&apos;s shaking VW, Eileen&apos;s Nissan and Dave&apos;s Subaru get more conventional- but equally entertaining- diagnoses.</description>

<description>When the producer is away, our cats will play. The boys figured out where producer Doug Berman hides his spare housekey and spend this week&apos;s showtime raiding Dougie&apos;s fridge and torturing his cat inbetween calls. Shelly and her misbehaving clutch, Jennifer with her &apos;possessed&apos; dashboard and Larry with his noisy Mercedes are all accomplices.</description>

<description>The important think tanks tackle global peace, poverty and the really deep problems facing humanity. Tom and Ray&apos;s &apos;Bushings Institute&apos; set their sites a bit lower: Where is Stacey&apos;s oil leak coming from?.. When is the right time to sell your Saab?.. and how can the boys settle the $100 bet between Sarah and her friend fairly and still take their standard 50% commission?</description>

We&apos;ve got the Bosnian Vowel Drop, Arup Gupta, the original Melissa Peterson letter, Death Valley Dinesh, and the circumferentially challenged Daniel Pinkwater reading highlights from the BMW owner&apos;s manual. Also, Dana needs help removing a chunk of the Berlin Wall from a friend&apos;s trunk, and Christy decides it&apos;s time to &apos;fess up to her Dad about destroying his car 15 years ago. All this and more, on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Our roster includes space shuttle astronaut John, whose government vehicle had a slight hesitation problem at 17,000 miles per hour; Gail, the Most Wanted Tollbooth fugitive at the Betsy Ross Bridge; Dave from Bemidji, MN, whose road trip from Alaska included using a campfire grill to fix his catalytic converter; Will, whose old dog Moses "blew beets"; and the saga of one of our heroes, lawn chair pilot Larry Walters.

<description>Who better than Tom and Ray to solve a dispute between two brothers over a vintage Camaro? Well, lots of people, actually. But Cynthia wasn&apos;t able to reach any of them, so this week on The Best of Car Talk, she&apos;ll hope our heroes can bring peace to Thanksgiving this year. Elsewhere, Virginia&apos;s Honda keeps getting stolen and returned. She&apos;s resorted to drastic measures to protect it, but would she be better off just leaving the car unlocked and engine running? Also, John&apos;s Corvette&apos;s engine is misfiring, but John&apos;s hesitant to go to the dealer since the miss only occurs above 140 mph; and why did Bill&apos;s attempt to replace a broken belt with his daughter&apos;s tights fail? All this, plus a few u</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, we hear from Tom and Ray&apos;s all-time #1 nemesis, Melissa Peterson. Years after her first missive, Melissa wants to remind the guys that she (and her dog) still hate them, but would they mind giving her some potentially life saving advice? Elsewhere, Eric&apos;s horn started blaring in he middle of the night, and he resorted to a hammer to silence it. So now he&apos;s got a busted horn and still doesn&apos;t know what set it off. Also, Pat&apos;s Lumina is running out of gas with several gallons still in the tank; Farrah&apos;s VW is blowing hot air non-stop; and Suzi&apos;s Porsche has become a great conversation starter with her male colleagues, but she can&apos;t answer any questions to keep the conversation going.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Vern&apos;s sister-in-law&apos;s husband accused him of wrecking the engine in his Windstar by adding too much oil. On a scale of 1 to 10, how guilty should Vern feel? And does their tenuous connection on the family tree drive the guilt meter into negative numbers? Also, tales of VW Bugs: Maureen&apos;s caught on fire, and she&apos;s hoping for some encouragement that it won&apos;t happen again, while Wendy is wondering if the one she&apos;s been gifted by her parents can make it from Kansas to Washington. Also, a close call at Car Talk Plaza—how our Producer Dougie&apos;s laziness have saved his life. All this and more, this week on The Best Car Talk.</description>

Should she just throw the keys instead of a bouquet? Elsewhere, Glen&apos;s wife is a parish priest in need of a new car, and a cure for her habit of driving 120 mph. Also, Karen learned why you should let sleeping cars lie after her perfect Civic started running lousy following a tune-up; Jerry&apos;s taillight is exploding every few weeks; and our on-call Physicist Wolfgang helps settle the great keyless remote dispersion debate.

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Ray takes Male Answer Syndrome to a whole new level, trying to explain why Dave&apos;s keyless remote works better when Dave points it at his chin rather than the car. Is the Great Dispersion Theory utterly brilliant, or utterly booooogus? Elsewhere, Andy dropped a straw in his dad&apos;s Buick&apos;s gas tank, and somehow "forgot" to mention it. Now that dad&apos;s car is running lousy, does Andy need to &apos;fess up? Also, Doris need to dump her mechanic after he sent her away with a pegged temperature gauge; and in a follow-up, we hear from Elisa&apos;s boyfriend Tracy and find out if he accepted her mom&apos;s offer of a new car if he popped the question. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Katherine&apos;s new job got off to a bumpy start (literally!), when she rear-ended her boss&apos; shiny new car on her first day. Katherine has been eyeing a new car herself, but should she wait for her first performance review? Meanwhile, Elisa&apos;s parents say they&apos;ll buy her a new car if she marries her live-in boyfirend. Should she accept, or will she be opening the door to future car-motivated life events? Also, Spencer couldn&apos;t resist the urge to touch his lugnuts, and found them to hot handle; Brett gets a shock every time he gets out of his Camry; and what does your Oreo cookie strategy say about your pesonality? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, got a pencil neck and an empty summer calendar? Tom and Ray are here for you, with the first (and probably last) Geek Week Summer Camp. Elsewhere, Shelly thinks she&apos;s killing a small animal when she turns her Subaru&apos;s steering wheel, because of the noise it makes. Might it actually be one of the gerbils powering its engine? Also, Steve&apos;s power steering needs a wake-up call for five minutes into his morning drive; Jackie&apos;s boyfriend&apos;s starting technique not be hurting her truck, but is doing a number on her back; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Roy really had a stuck brake caliper or if Tommy is going to be dining on his hat. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Katie&apos;s roommate&apos;s pseudo-scientific explanation for getting her Civic&apos;s door stuck on a sidewalk struck her as bogus, so she&apos;s turning to two pseudo-MIT grads. Can Tom and Ray separate truth from bogosity? Elsewhere, Tim and Pam need a ruling on whether his joyride on a washboard road crushed her Saturn&apos;s engine mounts. Also, can Gene&apos;s Corolla survive 100,000 miles with a leaking fuel pump and axle seal, and a dope slap reminder to check both daily; Flo&apos;s Mazda has bad universal joints or jockey shorts that are too tight; and after two years of driving with a wobbling rear wheel has Keller&apos;s luck run out? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Steve left a fresh turkey in his car for a week, and well, things don&apos;t smell so fresh anymore. Will any combination of soap, air freshener, and bad cologne get the stench out, or does Steve need to call Vinny the Torch? Elsewhere, Michael doesn&apos;t know if he should be worried about a couple of green spark plugs; Maggie&apos;s son has fallen in love with a hand-me-down Buick Regal that could kill him; and Linda is about to relocate from Ohio to the Virgin Islands. She wants to know if she should bring her Corolla. Tom and Ray want to know if Linda can fit them in her suitcase. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week, The Best of Car Talk kicks off with some of our favorite Country song titles. Can anything top, "I&apos;d Rather Pass a Kidney Stone Than Another Night With You?" Then it&apos;s off to Maui, where Jeff would be advised to stop bragging about the weather if he wants to find out why his brake pedal is sinking to the floor. Elsewhere, Inga is wondering which of her several mistakes caused her parked car to lurch down hill; Matt&apos;s brother talked him into a DIY timing belt change on his Acura, and a month later, the car still isn&apos;t running right; Bryan would like his vintage pickup truck to handle like a Dodge Viper; and can Stephanie&apos;s Corolla survive a cross-country trip? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ellen&apos;s Civic has been in three crashes, vandalized nine times, and had a tree fall on it, all of which has somehow convinced Ellen the car is cursed. If she tries to sell it, does she have to divulge these mishaps? Elsewhere, Keller&apos;s Beetle is missing its front passenger floorboard. Will a "found" street sign and a friend with an oxyacetylene torch cover the hole, without a 911 call? Also, Peter&apos;s Jeep knows when he&apos;s in a hurry, and chooses those moments to not start; Sandra accidentally pumped five gallons of diesel into her Odyssey, and can Warren really live a happy life without a working oxygen sensor in his Camry? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Cynthia is so convinced her gas mileage improves when she gets her oil changed, she bet her boss 100 bucks. If she can&apos;t win on technical grounds, might Tommy the Philosopher King be able to bail her out? Elsewhere, Linda be on firmer scientific footing by claiming her husband&apos;s "wah-wah" pedal driving style is doing more harm than good. Also, Joyce&apos;s hood won&apos;t open, and given the overall condition of her car, an air chisel might be the right tool; Scott is looking for eco-friendly windshield washer fluid, and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray helped Laurie&apos;s Pathfinder lose its nickname, "Wobble Butt". All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Slackers of the world, unite! Ah, never mind, that&apos;s probably too much effort. But this week The Best of Car Talk pays tribute to those dedicated to avoiding the rat race. In matters automotive, Liz&apos;s husband really wants to celebrate the end of his medical residency by buying a used Porsche, but Liz is worried the repair bills will negate any salary increase he&apos;s about to receive; Julie is wondering if her Accord&apos;s electrical problems are related to the series of "encounters" (accidents) she&apos;s had; and Marc&apos;s gas mileage appeared to increase by 20 percent after he left the gas cap off. Should OPEC be worried? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, is there a better Mother&apos;s Day gift than a kid helping his mom work on her car? Well, Anne might have done better with breakfast in bed. Her four-year-old son Matthew "helped" by pouring Ring Seal into her Jeep steering reservoir. Is next year&apos;s Mother&apos;s Day gift going to be a new car for Mom? Elsewhere, Bruce&apos;s tire is being attacked by air pressure goblins in the night; Ellen wants her Accord&apos;s door to stop squeaking so her new neighbors won&apos;t know how late she&apos;s getting home at night; and is it time for Steve to say goodbye to his beloved, wallet-draining Datsun or could it have a future life as a coffee table?

<description>You&apos;re driving down a long hill in San Francisco. Your brakes fail and there&apos;s a stop sign at the bottom. What do you do, aside from uttering every prayer in the book? This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray offer two suggestions, one of which might actually help avoid a big hospital bill. Elsewhere, Robin loves her Tourismo, even though it needs more than $1000 worth of repairs and it&apos;s causing a family rift. Is it time for her to kiss it goodbye? Also, Alex thinks her boyfriend&apos;s technique have led to the premature demise of his Jetta&apos;s shifter; Finley needs help convincing his friend to baptize his new truck by hauling some manure; and after losing a lot of money to the IRS, will Ruth have to lose even more to her mechanic because of her Achieva&apos;s coolant leak? All this, plus a round of Stump the Chumps, and more--this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Savannah wants to decorate her Plymouth Sundance with rhinestones because, well, they couldn&apos;t make it look worse, could they? Is she going to appear even more wacko by asking Tom and Ray for advice? Elsewhere, Peter wish that the whining sound coming from his car is his mother-in-law after he finds out what it&apos;s going to cost to make it go away; over in Germany, Steve is wondering whether his Tracer can survive keeping up with the BMWs going 100 on the Autobahn; and Richard is so desperate to find out why his cab has vapor lock, he&apos;s willing to kick out a passenger so he can talk to Tom and Ray. All this, plus one listener&apos;s fond Puzzler memory, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, thanks to modern research we can decipher what your mechanic is trying to tell you through his grunts. Meanwhile, Liz can only communicate her Volvo&apos;s steering problem through song. Elsewhere, Marni wants to pay tribute to her departed dad by pouring some of his ashes into his beloved Corvette&apos;s gas tank; Su (yes, that&apos;s how she spells it) wants to use a hair dryer to straighten her dented fender; and is the whirring noise Eric is hearing the death-bed cry of his Saab&apos;s turbo? Also, advice for Noah who&apos;s "going away" for a year, and wants his van to start when he gets back. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Laurie&apos;s Pathfinder earned the unfortunate nickname "Wobble Butt" because its rear end rocks from side to side. Can Tom and Ray calm Wobble Butt down and save it from further embarrassment? Elsewhere, Bob wants to know just how wacko his brother in law is for proposing adding duct work to improve the heat in Bob&apos;s mom&apos;s car. Also, Ellen&apos;s dad scolded her for having too many keys on her key ring; Chris got a little aggressive with his Dremel tool on his Camry; and Ray shares the joys (and terrors) of teaching middle school, while trying to help Susannah strengthen her anemic windshield wiper squirt. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Chris has flowers growing in his Belvedere, after birdseed got into his fresh air vent. To make matters worse, a kid stuffed chunks of blue cheese in the vents, so the car is stinky, too. Elsewhere, good intentions go really bad when Todd buys his girlfriend a 1973 Ford LTD, on the premise it would be safe and easy to work on. The car&apos;s loud backfire has led to one dead cat, several deceased goldfish, and one very strained relationship. Also, Andy wants to know if electronic gizmos can improve his Suburban&apos;s gas mileage to, say, 5 miles per gallon; and Dari wants to know if her truck is safe to drive, or sell, after falling off a lift. If she decides to sell, does she need to mention it?</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Merriam-Webster helps answer the second most-asked question in Car Talk history: which brother is "Click" and which is "Clack." Unfortunately, they can&apos;t the answer the most-asked question: How did these jerks get on the radio in the first place? Elsewhere, Lee&apos;s mechanic told him he has a cracked "whoop tube," which or not refer to Lee&apos;s Town Car; a wayward binky has Marietta&apos;s driver&apos;s seat stuck in a bad spot; and traveling musician Valerie can&apos;t decide whether to dump the Dodge van that tows her trailer in favor of a Cadillac—sounds like a no-brainer to us! Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Wendy used the snorkel test to figure out why her husband is fogging up her car. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, if Art passes his AMC Concord onto his 16-year-old son, is he setting the kid on a life path of collecting junk cars? In other words, Art wants to know what Tommy&apos;s first car was. And worse, would the Concord doom his son to no social life? Elsewhere, James is about to relocate to Haiti, but needs a car with high ground clearance. His Honda Civic not fit that description. Also, Wendy&apos;s husband is fogging up her car; Troy&apos;s VW sounds "satanic" at 1500 RPM, and Mary Rawson&apos;s friend offered to fix her brakes, but wants to be more than just friends. If she stops his advances, can she expect her car to stop? All this, plus the bright side of an expensive diagnosis, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jim thought he had a disaster on his hands after he left his gas cap off during a rain storm, but his pal came to the rescue by pouring mothballs into the gas tank. Can Tom and Ray give any explanation for why the mothballs got Jim&apos;s truck running? Meanwhile, Ray&apos;s got a theory about Heather&apos;s Jeep&apos;s popping noise that win points for creativity and bogosity. Also, Patrick hopes the guys can help him design the perfect soapbox derby car; Ann needs assurance that putting a new engine in her beloved Fuego isn&apos;t the most ridiculous idea ever; and has one of our listeners identified the true scent of a man? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Stella bought matching Monteros for her kids but dumped one because it spent more time in the shop than on the road. Should she be worried about the second Montero? Who better to weigh the chances there&apos;s one good brother and one evil brother than Tom and Ray? Elsewhere, Heather has taken to calling her Jeep "Clunking Matilda"; Abe has an idea to navigate traffic in Our Fair City that get him to work faster (but with a fat lip); and can Anne risk one more road trip in her overheating Subaru before it blows up?

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, how do you handle a slightly anal retentive dad who insists on keeping verrrry thorough car records? If you&apos;re Rebecca, you ignore Dad&apos;s beloved gas mileage book, tell Dad what you really think, and then call on Tom and Ray to try to get Dad to re-open his wallet. Elsewhere, should Carl try quieting his Rolls Royce by bending the door frame, or splurge for official Rolls duct tape? Also, Jane fears her mechanic have purged her of $87 with a bogus repair; Ben&apos;s girlfriend thinks he needs to factor wind chill into warming up his Rabbit; and Tom and Ray ponder how one sign with two simple words could lead to a utopian society. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Joyce&apos;s mild-mannered husband teaches meditation by day, but when he gets behind the wheel, he turns into a cross between Mario Andretti and Tony Soprano. Is it the car, the traffic, or does Joyce&apos;s husband have a dark side? Elsewhere, Andrew is concerned about his washer fluid lacking testosterone; Catherine has lived five years with a buzzing oil pressure indicator; and Aaron&apos;s Impala now takes off like it&apos;s dragging a ton of bricks. Also, Jim is worried he be a Fire Starter, after his battery and muffle both exploded. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, might three simple words be Cathy&apos;s best response to her dealer&apos;s accusation that she was lax in changing her Camry&apos;s oil? Elsewhere, Martin&apos;s love for his Cadillac has him concerned that he might actually be older than his Dad; Tony is sleeping on the sofa after his failed attempt to fix his wife&apos;s starting problem; and Sarah can only enter her car through the trunk, since the doors are frozen shut. Also, does the ECS light in Ilsa&apos;s Subaru mean "Expect Catastrophe Soon"? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Peterson is afraid to put air in his tires. Is he doomed to depending on the kindness of strangers with pumps, or can Tom and Ray help cure him—or at least outfit him properly in case there is an explosion? Elsewhere, towing be Dave&apos;s best option for transporting his beloved LeMans cross-country, because the car could fall off somewhere in Nebraska; Hanz can&apos;t decide if his wife&apos;s behavior at stoplights is utterly brilliant or utterly wacko; and Elizabeth be asking too much from her Volvo. Is shutting down when she turns on the wipers really such a big deal? All this, plus a world record for parking in a small space and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, is Phil&apos;s Buick Roadmaster making noise because of a steering problem or because he needs to make 20-point turns to navigate the narrow streets of Our Fair City? Elsewhere, Fred doesn&apos;t know whether he should listen to his mechanic or his FSTB (Future Son-in-Law To Be) on how to start the Alfa that&apos;s been sitting in his garage for a year. Will siding with the mechanic doom Fred&apos;s daughter&apos;s marriage? Also, Steve&apos;s driver&apos;s window glare screen is now a stuck-in-the-door glare screen; Alison&apos;s Golf be suffering from a "cracked breather" and "achin&apos; plugs"; and is Judy&apos;s Escort sending smoke signals that it won&apos;t make it to the moon? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mary loaded her Mustang&apos;s trunk with compost two months ago. Her husband says it&apos;s rotting the floor, but Mary wants to keep the compost all winter for ballast. One added wrinkle: Mary got the Mustang because her husband works for Ford—at least, for the time being. Elsewhere, Carla would love to escape from Alaska for a bit, but the fact that her truck will only drive backwards is making it difficult. Also, can Kathy figure out her Stratus&apos;s burnt popcorn smell without asphyxiating her sons? And is Justin&apos;s engine making noise, or is he just hearing people laughing a him for driving an old Beetle? All this, plus a plea for more civil Hate Mail, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Evelyn wants to know why a bolt of lightning spared her car and struck the road 20 feet away instead. Tom and Ray think Evelyn should just say a few kind words to the deity of her choice and move on, but will nonetheless offer a pseudo-scientific answer that&apos;s guaranteed to have MIT demanding its diplomas back. Elsewhere we find out if Bob&apos;s wife&apos;s car survived sucking a sock into the engine on Stump the Chumps; Gary&apos;s steering noise is scaring away his girlfriends; and did Barbara do more damage to her husband&apos;s truck, or her marriage, by driving a mile without any oil? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, can Ray grant one listener&apos;s Christmas wish by snorting less? And why can&apos;t Bob stop laughing about his Geo&apos;s starting problem? Elsewhere, Alan&apos;s Lincoln is starting to sound eerily like his mother; Karen&apos;s Caravan&apos;s dashboard is telling her she&apos;s always going 120 miles per hour on an empty gas tank; Steph wants to tempt the Blowout Gods by removing his Miata&apos;s spare tire so he&apos;ll have more trunk space; and Ariel is thinking of buying her first car and is wondering what level of protection she needs to bring to the dealer. Will a Rottweiler do or a big guy named Bruno? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, one listener postulates that a non-essential repair on an old car creates a parallel universe where everything else starts to break. Sorry, but for proof, you have to tune to the Sci-Fi Channel. Elsewhere in the land of semi-wacko theories, Mark was told he could use rice to clean a carburetor, and Joyce&apos;s boyfriend insists on leaving his Taurus&apos; trunk open overnight to keep it dry. Also, can Stephanie blame her mom for killing her Subaru&apos;s clutch, and is Mike&apos;s snowblower really not starting because it&apos;s too cold? And, John&apos;s mechanic ran into the age-old dilemma: Is it better to admit stupidity or gaslight the customer? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mike and his sons are about to embark on a two-year around the world sailing voyage, but the vintage Land Rover Mike&apos;s been restoring won&apos;t be much use at sea. Should he sell it or will late-night TV provide the perfect storage solution? Elsewhere, Lisa&apos;s wondering how much restitution she&apos;s entitled to for allowing her husband to buy a used Corvette; Charlotte&apos;s daughter spent $300 on a truck and have overpaid; and Arnie&apos;s Accord&apos;s harmonic balancers won&apos;t stay balanced.

<description>This week, The Best of Car Talk kicks off with the tale of one man&apos;s descent to Dante&apos;s supplemental Circle of Hell, the local health club, where he is at the merciless hands of his personal trainer, Tanya. Then we&apos;re off to Virginia, where Shelia&apos;s Maxima smells like someone burned her dry cleaning. Elsewhere, Ethan&apos;s preparing to sell his truck, which was struck by lightning. Should he advertise it as "pre-disastered" or keep quiet? Also, from the don&apos;t-try-this-at- home department, Marty&apos;s dad got their vintage car started by sucking gas through the exhaust with a shop vac, and he still has his eyebrows! All this and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, how many thousands of dollars can one hour of lousy car advice pump into an ailing economy? Well, when that hour starts with a Saab owner who&apos;s going to be transmission shopping, we be able to match the Gross Domestic Product of Guinea-Bissau. Or better. Things take a turn for the bearish, though, when Jacob scores a free do-over on his timing belt replacement-- and when Lee&apos;s Lincoln turns out to need a new "Whoop Tube." (How do you figure costs of replacing an imaginary part?) Happily, Laura brings us back on track. She loves her Camry so much, she can&apos;t wait to dump it and get something more suited to her growing dog. Also, someone be messing around with mileage markers in Montana; and, on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray help save Mark&apos;s socks from being soaked by transmission fluid? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Rich inherited a Buick that&apos;s been napping for four years. Can he start it right up without destroying it,or being enveloped in smoke? Elsewhere, Patrice&apos;s VW bus won&apos;t start, John Mark&apos;s backseat passengers are getting their feet soaked when he makes a turn, and Alana&apos;s gas tank is spitting fuel back out after she fills it. Also, is the threat of fire enough to convince Jim that replacing his tailpipe might count as a "necessary repair"? And, will a strategically placed blanket and light bulb really reduce Judy&apos;s engine wear by 95%? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Robin and our hosts have different approaches for ger VW&apos;s devilish steering problem. Elsewhere, Sue&apos;s boyfriend is afraid to get in the car with her due to her long history of accidents, near misses, and traffic violations. Sue insists she&apos;s a safe driver, so a full-scale Car Talk intervention be necessary. Also, Joe need to choose between a bungee cord and a 2x4 if he doesn&apos;t want to spring for a new transmission; and can Randy just keep adding a quart of oil to her Civic and live her life? Depends on whether her life involves driving the car! All this, plus more than you ever wanted to know about the hazards of adding urine to a radiator.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Andy&apos;s car overheated in the desert. With no water on hand, his girlfriend convinced him to use the only liquid available. We&apos;re bordering on TMI here, so we&apos;ll just say that Andy is now worried about said liquid&apos;s acid causing corrosion. Elsewhere, Judy and her Volvo just moved from Los Angeles to Chicago. What does she need to do to winterize her car, and herself? Also, Christian&apos;s clutch problems are threatening his career in pizza delivery; Magica&apos;s husband dropped a razor blade in the airbag compartment and thinks it&apos;s not a big deal; and should Louella risk her safety and sanity by teaching her teenage daughters how to drive stick shift?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Julia&apos;s worried that her Dad&apos;s attempt to replace the engine in Mom&apos;s Suburban might stress their marriage. Tom and Ray think it make their bond stronger than ever, even if the car is destroyed. Elsewhere, Tim&apos;s Dodge Dart rolled into a lake and went for a full dive. The car has been retrieved, but will it ever run again and not smell like fish? Also, Karen&apos;s physicist husband has a bogus explanation for why her car is shaking; Kelley wants to fix her Civic&apos;s brakes herself; and, Stu&apos;s girlfriend Carla accidentally added engine oil to his beloved ZX&apos;s power steering. So why are Tom and Ray asking Carla if she wants to dump Stu. All this, plus a round of Stump the Chumps, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Nancy doesn&apos;t fully trust her mechanic so she&apos;s throwing around car jargon to bluff him into thinking she knows more than she does. But, her vocabulary has run dry. Will the official Click and Clack Thesaurus come to her rescue? Elsewhere, Greg&apos;s truck&apos;s wiring has become lunch for critters and the only way to save it require giving up his beloved garage wood shop. Also, Kara&apos;s white-water rafting company have to do the unthinkable and switch to automatic transmissions for their trucks; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray knocked their heads together well enough to diagnose Debra&apos;s truck&apos;s knocking sound. All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, distilled water be too hungry for John to use it in his radiator. Will Ray&apos;s explanation of the hungry water theory help clarify things, or as usual, only further obfuscate matters? Elsewhere, Diana&apos;s van could be a new form of germ warfare; Rhadd&apos;s wild idling leaves him, Tom, and Ray all wishing our hosts were smarter; and, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Liz found her gas leak, and the perfect jumpsuit. Also, Todd&apos;s noisy truck gives Tom a chance to re-live his Army days with the long-suffering Sgt. McNeeley. Everybody will go on pass this weekend except Private Maaagleeeozi! All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dennis&apos; friend told him the best way to charge a low car battery is by turning on all the accessories. Does this earn immediate entry into the Wacko Theory Hall of Fame? Elsewhere, Julieta&apos;s boyfriend is blaming her driveway for his Camry&apos;s starting problem, which can only be cured by the correct curse words; Molly would like a little less cowbell in her Altima; and Gail explodes the myth that women don&apos;t play practical jokes. Also, how did a rental car&apos;s exhaust suck in Mike&apos;s daughter&apos;s shirt? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Bob&apos;s friend swears his Passat is getting an extra mile per gallon since he disabled the daytime running lights. Is this possible, or is he working overtime to believe it&apos;s happening? Elsewhere, Harmony stands accused of smashing her sister&apos;s car by taking her foot off the brake, but swears her foot never left the pedal; Bruce&apos;s son&apos;s Town Car needs a paint job but it will cost more than the car is worth; and Gina&apos;s husband is taking the fun out of his mid-life crisis convertible by being a little too careful—he&apos;s cleaning bugs off the windshield, while he&apos;s driving. Is Gina being too much of a nag trying to get him to stop, or are those dope slaps she&apos;s administering well earned? All this, plus the definitive explanation of Male Answer Syndrome and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Greg was surprised when his truck started running poorly, until he learned that his four-year-old son had washed the inside of the gas tank with soap. Should Greg stick his kid with the repair bill? Elsewhere, Judy can&apos;t decide if her son-in-law is brilliant or wacko for raising the hood of his Volvo after every drive; Gil&apos;s Camry be leaving a trail of clutch fluid from Houston to Phoenix; Debra&apos;s knocking is nothing compared to the sound of two hosts banging their heads together trying to figure out what&apos;s causing it; and, what does Gavin&apos;s car have in common with King Tut&apos;s tomb?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, did Christy destroy her dad&apos;s car 15 years ago by putting black tape over a flashing temperature light— and then continuing to drive? And is Dad ready to forgive and forget? It&apos;s one of our all-time favorite auto-familial disputes. Elsewhere, Andy got talked into replacing his front brakes to help stop a noise coming from the rear; Nancy&apos;s husband says she&apos;s risking death by keeping her air conditioning on recirculate; and should Mickey be concerned that she&apos;s on her fourth consecutive boyfriend who drives an &apos;82 Honda?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Donna&apos;s husband warned her not to let her new Camry&apos;s gas tank fall below 1/4 full, because the dregs might damage a crucial part. Does the fact that this part no longer exists automatically throw this advice into the Land of the Booooooogus? Elsewhere, John can only keep his car from stalling by opening the hood and touching the engine. Does this fix have anything to do with the fact that John&apos;s a Catholic priest? Also, Tom is looking for a "girlfriend car," but can&apos;t decide if his wife should be able to drive it; Michael will inherit his father-in-law&apos;s Town Car if he can figure out it&apos;s odd steering and stalling problem; and way up north in Alaska, Linda needs to retro-fit her ATV so her sled dogs will get their off-season workouts. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Stephanie&apos;s Volvo began making noise after she moved from California to Oregon. Tommy uses brilliant deductive reasoning to come up with a completely bogus explanation. Elsewhere, Karlene&apos;s mechanic diagnosed her Explorer&apos;s annoying squeak as "an annoying squeak," with no suggestions for quieting it. Can Tom and Ray do perhaps just a wee bit better? Also, Ed need to resort to healing crystals to start his son&apos;s Taurus; Larry has a chance to take part in a wonderful bonding experience with his 14-year old son and is looking for any way to get out of it; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Michelle is happily driving around Spokane in her $700 dream truck or if it&apos;s doing duty as a lawn ornament in her backyard. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ryan took his car in for an oil change and got talked into an engine shampoo. Will Tom and Ray reassure him that he&apos;s not a complete idiot? At least he didn&apos;t get a cream rinse. Elsewhere, Bill parked his rental car on a beach, and discovered the next morning that the tide had rolled in—to the car. He&apos;s bailed the water, but hasn&apos;t told the rental company. Also, Ray channels Frank Costanza to try to diagnose Kevin&apos;s clicking noise; Jean is suffering a run of flat tires in her driveway; and, is a lucky doughnut enough to keep Tamatha&apos;s brakes from burning up for a third time? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, physics research suggests that Tom in fact be Superman. You&apos;ve never seen them photographed together, have you? Elsewhere, Grant&apos;s marriage counselor suggested he and his wife turn to Tom and Ray to help settle their auto-marital dispute over keeping the radio on while the car is off. Will our hosts bring peace, or will Grant&apos;s next appearance be on Divorce Court? Also, Mark decided to replace his working transmission, and has now gone through six failed rebuilds in 6 months; Mabel&apos;s Subaru is leaking oil from every orifice; Tulis&apos;s mechanic be relying too much on prisms and crystals trying to fix her Civic&apos;s brakes; and is Jessica&apos;s car shocking her because of her clothes, her hair, or its ugly upholstery?

Elsewhere, Caroline&apos;s poor clutch technique be destroying her relationships;  Nancy boyfriend&apos;s MR2 is burning oil, which say more about his personality than the car; and John&apos;s pickup sounds like Buddy Rich is playing drums under the hood. Also, is something really wrong with Dana&apos;s starter motor or have her parents taken action to get her to stop lounging on their couch?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mary wants to sell her Accord, but it has a leaky water pump. Does she get the work done, knock the price down, or none of the above? Can Tom and Ray put their inner mechanic aside, and guide her to a clear conscience, or do they need an outside consult? Elsewhere, Tina just learned a scary and stinky lesson about why you shouldn&apos;t drive drive down a mountain in neutral; Jerry is looking for an alternative to the "stick and ballet pose" method he&apos;s using to get his convertible top to work; and we revisit the Waccabuc Incident: Was Sally&apos;s vision of a flashing light an atmospheric abnormality, or a call to  the mothership?

Will Tom and Ray have a mechanical explanation, a metaphysical explanation, or (most likely) a boooooogus explanation? Elsewhere, Toby wants her husband to get rid of her old BMW, but he&apos;s proving as immovable as the car; Sally is getting half her husband&apos;s mileage, and hopes it&apos;s not because she&apos;s buying cheap gas from Rotten Robbie; and Derek&apos;s dog would really appreciate it if Derek could get his Impreza to stop lunging forward.

<description>This week, Car Talk celebrates Mother&apos;s Day with a special appearance from Tom and Ray&apos;s long-suffering mom, Elizabeth. She&apos;ll spill the beans on what life was like in the Magliozzi household, and do her best to evade the question of which of her kids she liked best. She&apos;s also ready to give out advice to new moms ("You&apos;ve got a long way to go, sweetheart!"); get to the real reason one caller really wants to teach his mom to drive ("Is she going to leave you a lot of money?"); and, offer a final thought on Motherhood that will have Tommy blowing coffee out his nose. Lizzy even be able to top her sons in figuring out why Sandy&apos;s Mitsubishi is groaning, and how Linda can stop the air leaks that are turning her Accord into a wind tunnel. Join us for a visit to the Maternal Combustion Department, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, a salute to Edwards Bulwer-Lytton, the writer who set the bar for bad opening sentences with, "It was a dark stormy night." Can any current authors hope to match him? Elsewhere, Liz wants to use her Maxima to remove some unwanted shrubs from her yard,  but is worried her bumper will wind up as part of the landscape. Elsewhere, Nancy&apos;s 16-year old son wants a muscle car. Will she be abdicating all parental responsibility if she buys him one, and is there a good alternative that&apos;s big, ugly, and cool? Also, Pam wants to ease her husband&apos;s guilt over denting her door; Charles succumbed to Male Answer Syndrome trying to diagnose his wife&apos;s noisy Voyager; and, is Kirk&apos;s steering problem a result of Post-Alignment Euphoria, or Post-Alignment Anxiety?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, unearthed letters from summer camp prove that the child really is the father to the man, at least when it comes to our Technical, Spiritual and Menu Advisor, John Bugsy Lawlor. Elsewhere, Lee liberated herself from her mechanic by changing her own oil, but also got liberated from her cash when she poured the oil into her transmission; Author Cameron needs a lesson in how to burn rubber; and, Jane and her husband want to buy a stretch limo to cruise around town in, because, well, why not? Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Eddie and Edie Electron made their way home in Michelle&apos;s Saturn. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, did the battery in Keith&apos;s electric winch give up its life to lift a tree trunk? If so, how can Keith honor its memory? Elsewhere, Anne&apos;s family is planning a cross-country road trip. Is their Mercury Villager up to the task, or likely to wind up being pushed off the top of Pikes Peak when the engine fails? Also, Arlene wants her recently retired husband to learn how to work on their six cars. He says cars are too complicated, but is he just blowing smoke? And, Cindy&apos;s family loves the nurse they hired to take care of Cindy&apos;s Mom, but she has a nasty habit of backing into garden gnomes (and other objects) whenever she drives. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, after driving in Massachusetts for the first time, Addie is baffled by the concept of the rotary. Happily, Tom and Ray can explain its true purpose. Elsewhere, is "Backseat Driver Syndrome" incurable? Lani got used to yelling at her husband when he was a stinko driver, but now that he&apos;s doing better behind the wheel, she&apos;s still nagging from the passenger seat. Also, Christine is wondering if she needs to give up knitting in the passenger seat, lest a deploying airbag turn her needles into projectiles; Jem needs to clean a stuck valve, but the gunk be the only thing holding his engine together; and even after three alignments, Russ still thinks his car be headed for a ditch. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Deb is extending 3-minute errands into 20-minute excursions, because her headlights won&apos;t turn off until the car warms up. Is her best fix a new switch, or loose wires and liberation? Elsewhere, the good news for Allison is that there are still sparks between her and her husband. The bad news is, we mean that literally. Also, the Click and Clack Forensics team tries to figure out why Sarah&apos;s Volvo burst into flames on her way home from its 60,000-mile service; Paul wants to take a Sawzall to his Subaru and transform it into a convertible; and, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bill cut the cable that was keeping his Tahoe from sinking to the bottom of a lake.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mara&apos;s husband says he&apos;d rather drive a horse and buggy than a minivan. But, with one kid on hand, and twins on the way, are there any options other than an Odyssey or spurs? In another auto-marital dispute, Pat and her husband disagree over whether driving their daughters 3/10 of a mile to school in cold weather is killing their car. Also, after meditating for three months, Conrad found his Civic in an immovable state, thanks to a frozen parking brake; Peter wants to rid his garage of bats, but wind up on the ASPCA&apos;s Most Wanted list; and, trying to solve one of Ray&apos;s Puzzlers leads to a police visit.

<description>Will&apos;s beloved dog Moses got carsick and puked on the dashboard of Will&apos;s now not-so-beloved Ford Ranger. Will&apos;s mechanic wants a couple hundred bucks to remove the dashboard and clean out the vents. Is there a cheaper, if messier, solution? Elsewhere, Jeffrey and his girlfriend disagree over how often to wash the road salt off their cars in the winter--their dispute might have something to do with the fact that Jeffrey drives a junky Tercel while his girlfriend has a shiny Subaru Legacy. Also on the relationship front, Beth&apos;s boyfriend says her fender bender on an icy road is the reason why only one rear wheel is spinning on his Mustang. His accusation be the reason he soon be Beth&apos;s ex-boyfriend. And, why does Kenneth&apos;s car sound like a cow mooing when it slows down?</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, meet Tommy&apos;s new best friend, Paul. After the screws holding Paul&apos;s gas pedal fell through the rusted floor of his &apos;78 Datsun, Paul eschewed a body shop and found a cheap fix at his local cobbler. Now he needs a podiatrist to help with the limp his brilliant solution gave him. Elsewhere, neat freak Doug thinks his wife is a slob when it comes to cars, so he&apos;s considering buying a stick shift so she can&apos;t drive it. Also, Kathy&apos;s sister&apos;s boss suggested putting mothballs in her VW Bus&apos;s gas tank to improve mileage; Donna&apos;s husband was told to leave his car running an extra 15 minutes in really cold weather to charge the battery, but can&apos;t remember to shut it off; and on Stump the Chumps, did Dr. Paul find a new car and a new girlfriend, after his life turned into a country song?

Up in Maine, Paula&apos;s Subaru won&apos;t start in really cold weather unless she lies a heated blanket on the engine for 10 minutes. She&apos;s getting tired of waiting, and having her neighbors think she&apos;s nuts. Meanwhile, out on Martha&apos;s Vineyard, Betsy&apos;s Toyota Echo is sliding around in the snow, making it difficult to get to team sword dancing practice. Also, Deanie&apos;s husband and father are arguing over the best time to check the dipstick; and Peter&apos;s wife always said, "A car is just a car", until she drove his new Jaguar, and decided it was a little different from her Accord.  All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, let&apos;s escape winter for a few minutes with a ride in the &apos;75 Pontiac convertible Red, just bought off someone&apos;s front lawn. Hey, are those flames shooting up from the carpet? Elsewhere, a potential fire is just one reason Gladys is too scared to use the remote starter she got for Christmas. Also, Trent thinks his van suffered a stroke, taking out the power window, blinker and tail lights; Josie inherited a VW Westfalia with the annoying habit of starting itself and and driving off; and Lucia put a 150-pound log in her Corolla&apos;s trunk to prevent fish-tailing in the snow, but is worried it might be doing damage elsewhere. All this, plus the real origins of 4-Wheel Drive, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Steve&apos;s wife gave him a homework assignment--write a paper explaining why he should keep the &apos;77 MG he bought a year ago, but has left sitting in the garage. But does Steve love it enough to defend it? Elsewhere, Helen&apos;s tires are growing mold. Tom and Ray say it&apos;s because Helen drives the car infrequently, to which Helen replies, "Au contraire Piston Pusses!" Also, Linda&apos;s fiance insists on washing his car before a long trip, to improve its gas mileage; Heather thinks an opera singer is hanging out under her Civic; and, you&apos;ll be shocked, shocked to learn that John&apos;s "cheap and reliable" Ferrari is proving to be neither. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Nina&apos;s mechanic ripped off her Altima&apos;s heat shield and said she can live without it. But Nina&apos;s seen enough Star Trek episodes to worry she might burn up on re-entry without it. Elsewhere, Steve expected to encounter snow during his winter cross-country drive, but he wasn&apos;t prepared for flurries inside his Pathfinder. Also, Jean&apos;s brakes started screeching after she got new pads, apparently with the "banshee" option; John&apos;s daughters&apos; know-it-all boyfriends have convinced them they need to let their cars warm up for a loooong time on cold mornings; and Ray discovers new automotive healing powers. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Kim and her husband each made questionable car purchases. He got an abandoned Lexus, while she went for an ancient VW Campervan. Who gets bragging rights for being more wacko? Meanwhile, another marital dispute is brewing in Alaska, where Samantha and her husband can&apos;t agree on the best place to hang dry cleaning. Can Tom and Ray referee his one, without knowing exactly what dry cleaning is? Back on the wacko front, Stephan&apos;s solution to his Golf&apos;s rough running earn him the "Big W" on his repair slip. And on Stump the Chumps, we find out if John&apos;s wife made it from Buffalo to San Diego in her Cabriolet, in less than six months. All this, plus Math with Dummies, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jill&apos;s pal keeps telling her she needs to do more highway driving to "blow the stuff" out of her car. Jill&apos;s not opposed to this on principle, but she would like to know what she&apos;s trying to blow out. Elsewhere, Eleanor is leaving on a 6-month around the world bicycle tour and she wants to know what to do with her truck while she&apos;s gone. Tom and Ray want to know how Eleanor plans to pedal across a few oceans?! Also, after Lauren&apos;s boyfriend drove down Mount Washington with the emergency brake on, Lauren is wondering if she needs new brakes, and a new boyfriend. And, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Marc rescued his Peugeot from his mechanic, and whether he wishes he hadn&apos;t. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, could cow stomach magnets have improved the gas mileage on Tim&apos;s Jaguar? Or is that udderly (sorry) ridiculous? Meanwhile, down in Antarctica, summer is coming, but Matt&apos;s vehicle is still having trouble when the thermometer dips below a balmy minus 40 degrees. And, Tom and Ray are in the holiday spirit with some creative gift suggestions for men, comforting advice for Adrian who wants to put a wreath on her car but is worried it will spontaneously combust, and a lesson for Scott that it is the stingy man who spends the most.

<description>Out in Gustavas, Alaska, Janet and her neighbors like to stop and talk to each other when they&apos;re driving. One of the topics: whether their cars are better off idling or being shut off during the conversation. This week on the Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray weigh in, and one Magliozzi manages to book himself a night sleeping in the garage. Elsewhere, Heidi&apos;s Lincoln is under attack from a bird that&apos;s pecking at its own reflection. Can Heidi protect her car without landing on the Audubon Society&apos;s Most Wanted list? Also, Shawn&apos;s Caravan seems to be channeling Maurice Chevalier; John got a smokey lesson in what happens when you leave the filler cap off after an oil change; and Steve&apos;s truck is bouncing like a basketball on bumpy roads. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Prashanth&apos;s new wife is about to come to America for the first time. Should he greet her with his beat-up Corolla, spring for a new car, or try to fake it by renting something until it&apos;s too late for her to turn back to India? Elsewhere, Al stands accused of "careless parking"—his brother says Al pulls into the garage in a way that makes it impossible to back out. Is this even physically possible? Also, Father Bob needs a heavy duty flasher, so he can hear his turn signals; a piece of hot molten lead fell on Pam&apos;s foot from under the dash while she was driving; and, Deanna&apos;s Civic&apos;s battery has been stolen several times in the last few months. Does she need a Rottweiler under the hood? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, we demonstrate just how much effort goes into. . . .embarrassing Tom and Ray. You didn&apos;t think we were talking about putting effort into the show, were you? Elsewhere, "Sweetie" has to decide whether to rebuild her Explorer&apos;s transmission or limp along without 5th gear, and Tom and Ray have to decide how many times they can call her Sweetie without getting into big trouble. Also, should Ruth follow her husband&apos;s or father&apos;s conflicting advice on tire pressure; Ellen thinks her mechanic is blowing sulfur up her skirt over her Camry&apos;s smell; Glen spilled a little oil and set his rental car engine on fire; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bill managed to drive a stick shift to the high school dance and save his social life. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Ben and his brother took their dad&apos;s Camry for a ride--in reverse, in the neighbor&apos;s yard, with the steering wheel cocked all the way to one side. They had a great time! The Camry&apos;s power steering, not so much. Elsewhere, Al and his friend disagree over whether to take speed bumps with two wheels or four; Kathy is miffed that her husband carries a picture of his beloved Studebaker in his wallet, but not one of her; Wendall, and his insurer, want to know why his truck caught on fire; and did a neighborly gesture really kill Daniel&apos;s alternator, as his wife predicted? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo&apos;s Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, &apos;fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray stray ever further into terra incognita, as they try to help Sharon figure out why her hair looks lousy after a long drive. Procter and Gamble have issues with Ray&apos;s diagnosis. Elsewhere, Sharon&apos;s car is making a "lurid groan" when she turns. The noise is making her a star at the retirement home, but should she be worried about it? Also, from the marital disputes department, Cathy thinks her husband erred by driving down Mt. Washington in 1st gear rather than riding the brakes; and Lynn is worried that a cold water car wash on a hot day can warp her brakes. And, has the New York Times really found the world&apos;s funniest joke? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jenny&apos;s fiance, a budding bryologist, thinks she&apos;s crazy because she swears her car is more difficult to start when its low on gas. Should he stick to moss and stay away from fuel dynamics, let alone female psychology? Elsewhere, Angela&apos;s smelling something sweet from her dashboard, but the cost to fix it will be mighty sour; Eric is wondering how a $4 part could require $358 in labor to replace; and David is trying to decide which of two heaps to dump, when the answer should probably be both. And, in the midst of New England foliage season, New Hampshire native Kurt has lots of time in traffic to profile the tourist drivers slowing him down the most. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Michelle&apos;s husband paid $170 for her dream car, and she thinks he have overpaid. It&apos;s just missing a few things, such as the rear windshield, the gas cap, chunks of the floor...and we haven&apos;t even gotten to all the problems under hood. Fortunately, Michelle is talking to a guy who can appreciate junk, and Tommy is as excited as her husband about this dream turned nightmare. Elsewhere, Mary discovered how big a rock it would take to kill her lawn mower; Matt is looking for music recommendation to drown out his Civic&apos;s brake noise; and can Tom and Ray convince Andrea the noise she thinks is coming from the dashboard is actually originating 3 feet away; and our on-call Physicist Wolfgang helps ease Ray&apos;s gastrointestinal distress. All this and lot more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Anne&apos;s mechanic can&apos;t identify the gunk blowing out of her car&apos;s ventilation system, but he does know that whatever it is, fixing it will cost $1000...if that&apos;s what it is. Sounds like a new mechanic&apos;s mantra to us! Elsewhere, Linda is still trying to figure out how a gas attendant put her radiator cap on backwards; Alan is baffled by the diamond patterns he sees on rear windshields, especially when he&apos;s wearing polarized sunglasses; and is Andy safer keeping his doors locked while driving on the highway? And, has our pal Daniel Pinkwater found his true calling, as a scientific measurement? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Are Tom and Ray carriers of a new form of ABS—Aberrant Behavior Syndrome? Meanwhile, tempers are also flaring out in California, where Jim&apos;s truck is polluting his entire town; and down in Hendersonville, Kentucky, where Brian&apos;s merging strategy is incredibly efficient, and also incredibly rude. Also, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Sarah&apos;s kids really held a peeing contest in her car while she was away; and, can Bill in Alaska get his forklift running in time to get us our halibut? All this, plus the return of the Puzzler, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, the best prank ever in Magliozzi history, as Ray&apos;s family vacation is interrupted by the unfortunate news that his beloved Ford LTD has "burned to a crisp." Elsewhere, grad student Erica hopes her Celica&apos;s rattle is serious enough to get Mom and Dad to buy her a new car; Jodi&apos;s oil burning put her Cavalier well ahead Erica&apos;s car on the path to heapdom; Unitarian Minister Carol is being tempted by a shiny Jetta; and can Vince put the leftover gas from his weedwacker in his car without destroying it? Also, if you keep taking a car apart and putting it back together, will you eventually wind up with two? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, two preteen kids present "Car Talk: The Video Game," and prove they&apos;re a lot more creative and have better marketing skills than anyone in our office. But, they probably can&apos;t beat Tom and Ray on car questions, right? We won&apos;t test that, but, the brothers will try to figure out why Martha&apos;s van stops moving and acts like it&apos;s run out of gas; what made Karl&apos;s horn start blaring early Sunday morning; and which heap Cass and her newly reunited husband should keep. Also, should Lee listen to a retired mechanic&apos;s advice and run his car for 15 seconds with a pint of kerosene and no oil? And, our listeners weigh in on whether or not to name a car. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Matt needs a car that can handle his annual 100,000 mile commute, and no, we didn&apos;t add too many zeros there. Matt is looking for reliability and good gas mileage, but Tom and Ray think he should be a bit more self-centered, particularly on the body part that will be chained to the seat for all those miles. Elsewhere, Marc is wondering if add-ons like the "Crap-a-Chip" will really improve his SUV&apos;s horrible mileage. Also, Mary Anne&apos;s air conditioning is cooling her passengers but not herself; Chip is wondering what fried his van&apos;s exhaust manifold; and Tom and Ray&apos;s efforts to help Becky deal with a film on her windshield are derailed by the Car Talk Studio Pranks department. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dana&apos;s wife&apos;s Volvo&apos;s brakes squeak, but only when Dana drives the car. Does his wife have a heavy foot or is Dana driving too much like a geek? Elsewhere, Louise made the mistake of taking her car to a specialist rather than a GP to diagnose a clunk; Sylvia thinks her Rabbit&apos;s array of problems are due to radiation poisoning from being parked near a uranium mine; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray correctly diagnosed why Ralph&apos;s Suburban was imitating an old TV game show. Also, a date goes awry when a Jaguar is mistaken for something else; and a few of Shakespeare&apos;s plays not coming to a stage near you. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, can an omelet save an engine? A friend suggested that Sasha use eggs in his cracked radiator. Was this advice to actually stop the leak, or just to give Sasha something to snack on while waiting for the tow truck? Elsewhere, John put wooden blocks under the gas pedal to slow down his leadfoot son; but is worried that the speeding tickets savings need to go towards a new transmission. Also, Debra need to resort to whacking the steering wheel to start her car; Ron&apos;s horn sounds when he turns his steering wheel; on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Heidi had to lock her husband in the cellar to keep him from changing her timing belt; and, are Tom and Ray&apos;s stupid questions really profound existential Philosophy? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, our all-time favorite demonstration of Male Answer Syndrome. The electric brakes on Paul&apos;s cattle trailer engage when he uses his turn signal. Will Tom and Ray&apos;s ready acknowledgment that they know nothing about electric brakes stop them from offering a diagnosis? Of course not! Is there any chance of it being a correct diagnosis? Of course not! Elsewhere, Alice and her husband are enjoying retirement by arguing over whose route to their daugher&apos;s house is better for their car. Also, Ralph&apos;s Suburban is channeling an old TV game show; Cathy&apos;s son locked her keys in the trunk and the retrieval has led to lots of chipped teeth; and will Marsha&apos;s husband&apos;s shifting habits kill her clutch permaturely? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Arlene bought an old Volvo for her teenage daughter, who promptly drove it off road and tried to fix its overheating by pouring Mountain Dew in the radiator. Does Arlene need to find her daughter a better teacher, or a convent? Also, Kate&apos;s mechanic husband can&apos;t figure out why her car has touble starting; Warren wants to treat his Olds to a paint job, but his wife is convinced that will make it die within two months; and Newton is still trying to figure out how his driver in Africa kept his Land Rover running for 60 miles by sitting on the engine with his hand over the carburetor.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Sarah left town for a weekend and came home to an array of disasters, including a minivan that smells like urine. Did her kids and husband hold a Physics-defying peeing contest while she was away? Elsewhere, Sissy&apos;s husband blow out the bogosity meter with his argument that she needs to park with the wheels straight to keep her car from going out of alignment; Paul&apos;s life turned into a country song when he totaled his car, his wife left him, and his dog died; and service advisor Charlie needs help figuring out how to blame his customers for their short brake life. Also, on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray get the heat working in Bob&apos;s Cavalier, or did summer get the heat working in Bob&apos;s Cavalier? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Nancy is looking for a vehicle she and her family can take to Belize for a year. Other than something big enough to haul back Cuban cigars for Tom and Ray, what should she be looking for? Elsewhere, Diane&apos;s husband thinks she&apos;s nuts for insisting there&apos;s more resistance in her gas pedal when the tank is full; Rebecca&apos;s best solution for her Accord&apos;s shifting problem be to return the car to her Dad; Lily hopes her Taurus&apos;s intermittent air conditioning can be resolved by buying a new Mustang; and Sandy&apos;s neighbors really want her to figure out why her car screeches first thing in the morning. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bob tried to bomb the flies out of his truck. All this, plus one listener&apos;s fondest Car Talk memory, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Rob&apos;s car has trouble starting unless he holds the key in the start position for several seconds. Does Ray&apos;s Emboldened Electrons theory mean Rob&apos;s electrical system needs to read Profiles in Courage? Elsewhere, Gary is guilty until proven innocent for his mother-in-law&apos;s T-Bird catching fire, and even exculpatory evidence not get him off the hook. Also, Isla&apos;s had to replace her Jeep&apos;s brake pads three times in the last year, and Midas says she&apos;s run out of free replacements; Carly has been living with a shaking Civic for two years; and Avital&apos;s ex-boyfriend is trying to convince her that motor oil behaves like bottled salad dressing.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Howard needs to drive a mattress from Boston to "Hunga-Dunga" and wants to know how to get negative lift, and keep it from flying off the roof of his car. Tom and Ray know one method that won&apos;t work, as evidenced by an ill-fated attempt to transport 18 sheets of plywood. Elsewhere, Peggy swears she heard the guys recommend mixing kerosene and water to wash a car, but isn&apos;t calling to sue for damages. Also, Scott&apos;s concerned about his truck not starting, but more worried about his friend "Fat Tony" fiddling around with his big bucket o&apos;tools; John managed to lock himself out of his car with the engine running and chose the most painful way to shut it off; and if Tom and Ray help Gillian translate a French truck description, are they really doing work for the CIA? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Erin&apos;s roommate doesn&apos;t drive her old car but won&apos;t get rid of it, and Erin is tired of having to move it every day. Is Erin&apos;s best solution philosophical or conflagratory? Elsewhere, Nathaniel&apos;s attempt to show off his Saab to his future in-laws went downhill, literally, when it rolled down their driveway on its own. Also, Dee&apos;s truck sounds like singing dogs; Norm wants to know how to get his Stanza running after storing it over the winter, but will first have to incur Tommy&apos;s wrath over a sore knee; and Nancy wants to convince her husband that his Acura can live without a bra. All this, plus Tom and Ray&apos;s brilliant new "do whatever you want" strategy, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jere agreed to drive her sister&apos;s co-worker&apos;s husband to work. Not only is he annoying in the car, when he gets to work he complains about Jere&apos;s driving behind her back. Does Jere need to switch to a one-seater? Elsewhere, Mark&apos;s Trooper is oozing fluid onto his feet. He thinks the fluid is red, but he might just be wearing red socks. Also, Sharon&apos;s trying to live with a stalling truck without killing the starter or clutch; Alicia&apos;s Camry has a furball problem; and is John negating the mid-life crisis benefits of his Miata by worrying whether to park indoors to preserve the hood? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Heidi&apos;s husband is a tennis pro, with a limited grasp of English, and an aversion to reading instructions. So he should have no problem changing her Volvo&apos;s timing belt, right? Elsewhere, Nathan dinged his girlfriend&apos;s Civic while driving it without her permission (or a license). Can Tom and Ray help him cover up his crime, at least until she hears the show? Also, agreed to teach her friend&apos;s teenaged son to drive, but has no idea where to begin; Andrew&apos;s Toyota has a bad case of crud accretion in the radiator; and over in Botswana, Dorothy&apos;s baboon behavior studies are on track thanks to a piece of wire keeping her Land Rover&apos;s fan from destroying the radiator. Is there a more permanent solution, other than Dorothy relying on Jane Goodall&apos;s Greatest Hits video for her studies? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Amy&apos;s brilliant husband&apos;s brain doesn&apos;t have room to process a few small details while driving, like keeping the car in his lane. Amy&apos;s screams of terror don&apos;t seem to be helping him improve, so she need to figure out a creative (and potentially disgusting) way to convince him she needs to drive. Elsewhere, seminary student Matt&apos;s truck is leaking oil onto someone else&apos;s driveway and fixing it would cost more than the truck is worth. Also, Tom&apos;s daughter is about to take a year off college to work on an organic farm 3,000 miles away. He&apos;s wondering if her truck can handle the drive, or if she&apos;ll need to find an organic farm 2,995 miles closer; Ellen&apos;s Sable has a flatulence problem; and Kimberly&apos;s BMW is having even more trouble adjusting to living in New York City than she is. All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Carl is about to receive his Master&apos;s degree in Coastal Management and is wracked with guilt about owning two gas guzzling SUVs. Will converting emissions systems help him feel better and keep the seas at bay? Elsewhere, Brian&apos;s drive to work is quicker and more scenic than his wife&apos;s, but on washboard roads, so is he going to spend all that saved time in his mechanic&apos;s lobby waiting for a new suspension? Also, Dr. Kenny is so concerned about his Civic&apos;s brakes that he&apos;s stepping out of surgery to seek help; Debbie&apos;s mechanic found a rag stuck in the remains of her Peugeot&apos;s oil filter; and Monica&apos;s husband insists on shifting his automatic transmission into neutral at stop lights to let the transmission rest. Does his brain need a nap? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fred saw a truck parked in the rain with its door open, so he did what any good guy would do—he closed the door. 30 minutes later, the truck was on fire, and Fred have caused it. Good intentions also went awry for Mare&apos;s husband, he put air in her Celica&apos;s tires, but mistook her car for a bicycle and filled them all the way to 90 psi. The parade of bad ideas continues with Richie who have cooked his engine by experimenting with a synthetic oil dual filtration system; Scott&apos;s "Uncle Know It All" who thinks overdrive should be avoided at all costs; Liz, who plans to drive from Oregon to Alaska in an &apos;85 Blazer; and our very own Ray, postulating that William Shakespeare was Italian.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Juliette&apos;s timing belt has lasted more than 230,000 miles. Should she replace it before she gets stranded on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, or see if it can make it all the way back from the moon? Elsewhere, Joanna is grateful her 16-year-old son doesn&apos;t want a Viper for his first car, but she is a little concerned that he has his eyes on a vintage ice cream truck. Also, Sarah keeps spilling water into her Saab&apos;s poorly located ignition; Deborah&apos;s Corolla is shaking after a clutch job, which be a case of FOL (Fell Off Lift); Bear need to change his 100,000-mile spark plugs&apos; name to "lifetime" since they&apos;re frozen in place; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if John cleaned his car, or let a first date see him for the slob he truly is. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Penny bought her ex-husband&apos;s third wife&apos;s old Volvo. If that sounds complicated, wait until you hear everything Penny&apos;s done to try to figure out why the car is overheating. Elsewhere, Scott&apos;s Festiva died after driving through a deep puddle and Scott&apos;s friend is trying to convince him his tailpipe managed to suck water and blow out exhaust at the same time. Also, Chandler is pondering a life without hubcaps after hers were stolen; Mike is looking for the right car to help his uncle get his kicks on Route 66; and Kathy needs help navigating the mind of the modern mechanic, who happens to be her husband. And, on Stump the Chumps, did Ellen finally find a way to distract her husband from the JC Whitney catalogue? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ann discovered her tire was on fire while driving home from a snowboarding trip. Her response demonstrates three of Tom and Ray&apos;s most admired qualities. Now, can they convince her to use some common sense? Elsehwere, Dana is concerned her husband has become overly attached to JB Weld; Dennis is being punished for the good deed of washing his wife&apos;s car; and Chris and her husband are arguing over whether shoveling snow out of a parking space grants ownership. Also, NASA researcher Anastas can&apos;t get a grant to find out if his Audi would perform in zero gravity, so he&apos;s turning to the next worst option, Tom and Ray. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Hey, would you happen to have a PhD in mockingbird poop? If so, Beth could use your help. She has to park her Camry below the home of a mockingbird that enjoys eating berries, and, um, has an active digestive system. Will Tom and Ray have any useful suggestions to help Beth poop-proof her car? Elsewhere, Shlomit&apos;s husband drives with two feet. Does the fact that he&apos;s a dancer make this any less wacko? Also, Scott keeps losing parking lot traffic cone races to his wife and is looking for ways to help him win, however underhanded; Abbie needs help persuading a physics professor to help her rent a car after he damaged hers; and Dan bought a used Corolla that have come with the previous owner&apos;s engagement ring hiding behind the dash. How did it get there? Find out this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, every time Michelle&apos;s friend steps on the brake, his car radio changes the station. If this only happened during our show, Tom and Ray could just compliment the radio on its good taste and move on, but they&apos;ll have to conjure some plausible explanation. Elsewhere, Leslie thinks her Chrysler committed autocide by rolling away while parked at her in-laws. Also, Cindy loves the Olds she inherited from dad, but could live without the cigar smell that came with it; and 3-time marriage loser Ken thinks he have better luck next time by scouting mates based on what they drive. All this, plus some brotherly advice gone haywire, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ed is building an airplane in his garage. It&apos;s not a model plane; it&apos;s one Ed actually intends to fly in. If you need more evidence that Ed has questionable judgment, he&apos;s asking Tom and Ray for advice on choosing an engine. Elsewhere, Cindy suffered CO poisoning, accidentally drove 70 mph in 3rd gear, and killed her engine. Subaru replaced it under warranty, but Cindy is feeling guilty about not giving them full disclosure. Also, Diane needs help convincing her husband to drive his shiny new pickup and stop throwing money at his ancient Chevy Citation; and meet our new superhero, Captain Destructo! All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, is the phrase, "Yes, dear," the key to a happy marriage--even if it&apos;s delivered with a smirk? The saga of one of Ray&apos;s most annoying purchases helps illustrate. In matters automotive, retired math teacher Angelina can&apos;t find a formula to back up her husband&apos;s claim that bigger tires will improve their Civic&apos;s gas mileage. Also, Tom and Ray are guaranteed to diagnose why Leland&apos;s Toyota can&apos;t pull a hill, if they can figure out what "pull a hill" means; and Tom seizes on one of his most brilliant/wacko/unencumbered-by-the-thought-process explanations for Kim&apos;s overheating engine. All this and more this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, can Carl mount a snow plow on the front of his Plymouth Voyager? Sure, if he wants to destroy it. But Carl have other options, that don&apos;t involve moving to Florida. Elsewhere, Elizabeth&apos;s truck hasn&apos;t started in months. In that time, it briefly caught on fire and was decorated with holiday lights by Elizabeth&apos;s neighbors. Can she restore its dingity by getting it running again? Also, Rick&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s VW spent a weekend at her mechanic&apos;s, and came back with 20,000 new miles on the odometer; Michael&apos;s horn has become a neighborhood nuisance; and Jessica can&apos;t get her mechanics to talk to her instead of her boyfriend. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, was Barry&apos;s truck an unwitting arsonist? He was driving home when the lights dimmed and flames began shooting out the back, setting the road on fire. Elsewhere, Danni bought a used Range Rover while in the midst of "Pregnancy Induced Insanity" (her words) and the car is already draining her wallet faster than her kid&apos;s college tuition will. Also, Amy&apos;s mechanics have replaced the wrong half of her engine; Charlie has replaced his fuel pump three times in the last year and his back would really like him to find one that can last more than a few months; and, forget Sonja Henie&apos;s Tutu. We have the tale of Sonja Henie&apos;s Zamboni! All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Steve is spending a lot of time helping his ex-wife Tammy navigate a trinity of car problems. Is he perhaps too invested, given the "ex" status of their relationship? Elsewhere, high schooler Natalie&apos;s Dad was away, so she borrowed his van, and (of course) got it dented. Can she fix it before Dad gets home, or does she need to &apos;fess up, or blame it on Mom? Also, Toast&apos;s battery drains in the rain; Julie has half a key stuck in her driver&apos;s door; and Jonathan&apos;s Volvo has a sagging rear end. Find out if Tom and Ray&apos;s resolution to stop giving stupid answers can actually make it to New Year&apos;s Day, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, finally an award Tom and Ray could achieve GOAT status in—wasting time. They&apos;ll demonstrate their dominance by ignoring Dodie&apos;s perfectly good question about leaving her car in overdrive, and instead relentlessly pry/probe into why only two of Dodie&apos;s four sons chipped in to buy her the car. Elsewhere, Bob&apos;s Cavalier has no heat, even though he&apos;s replaced just about every piece of the system; Patricia&apos;s Subaru is having trouble starting, which is making it even more difficult to navigate around the buffalo living in her front yard; and Steve thinks he have bitten off more than he can chew by taking on a Buick Roadmaster restoration. And, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Joan made it to Madagascar without flying with a set of tires in her bags. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>When one host insists that cars are made to be junked while the other won&apos;t drive anything not equipped with an AARP card, it&apos;s time for an intervention. So this week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray explore new ways of politely calling each other "jerk." Meanwhile, John needs to weigh his love for the family heirloom Chevelle against the dental bills its sensitive power brakes are causing. Elsewhere, Anwen&apos;s mechanic was one fuel pump short of diagnosing her Volvo&apos;s noise; Andrew&apos;s Corolla howls, but only at 30 miles per hour; and Craig ponders the age old question, why are gas filler doors not all on the same side? Also, John&apos;s wife and a friend are planning to drive from Buffalo to San Diego in a Cabriolet. Do they needs to take breaks every 10 hours, or every 90 minutes? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Paging Chief Counsel Hugh Louis Dewey! Rachel got into a fender bender because she was distracted by laughing at Car Talk. Are Tom and Ray liable? Elsewhere, Tom got a Caprice Wagon in exchange for a set of teeth he made, but the car&apos;s knocking sound is making him wonder if he should have only provided molars. Also, Abbie got some dodgy, and perhaps life-threatening advice on how to check her car&apos;s alignment; Dee can&apos;t accept a life without heated seats; and Phil is wondering if his wife really would be happier if she married a mechanic. All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Heidi&apos;s car is making a scary noise and having trouble steering--and worse, she can&apos;t find a mechanic who will take her seriously. Maybe because the car is an &apos;87 Peugeot? Meanwhile, Allen&apos;s earning his spot on mechanics&apos; and TV techs&apos; Top 10 Wacko Customer list with a Volvo that&apos;s starting itself and a TV that&apos;s turning itself on. Also, can Sharon ignore her husband and put a wreath on her Tahoe without voiding the Excess Pine Needle Intake clause of her warranty? And, will Lewis get better treatment from his VW dealer if he flashes his IRS agent card? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

His wife diagnosed it as roasting bugs, and Doug forgot Tommy&apos;s first rule of marital happiness when he told her, "You&apos;re nuts." Could she have been right, and can Doug get out of the doghouse? Elsewhere, Alex need help finding closure over his beloved pickup, while Christine can&apos;t decide whether to accept her parents&apos; offer of their Buick station wagon; and Tracy wishes someone would haul away the mysterious Stanza that&apos;s been sitting in front of her house for the last two months. Also, can Jim use an old transmission to run his potter&apos;s wheel? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Ever since the odometer rolled over, the car&apos;s been nothing but trouble and now Alan is ready to dump it. Might he be acting a bit prematurely? Elsewhere, Dave&apos;s commute get more complicated this winter, because his Audi&apos;s heater only works on right turns; Keri wants to soup up her scooter after it lost a race to a Vespa; and is Michael going to set off his airbag by drumming along with the Who?

<description>Who knew there was a pseudo-technical name for picking your nose in your car? This week on The Best of Car Talk, listeners who weren&apos;t completely disgusted by last week&apos;s discussion offer their analysis of automotive nostril penetrations. Elsewhere, Charlotte and her husband decided to spice up their lives by adopting four children and want to make things even more exciting by finding an old car they can use as a jungle gym. Also, Jody is searching for her Accord&apos;s chi, so she can use acupuncture to get rid of a ticking noise; JD just lost his girlfriend and fears his truck&apos;s engine will be the next to go; and will a nice grapefruit stabilize John&apos;s Jeep&apos;s oil pressure? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Greg&apos;s truck is making noise. The good news is Tommy came prepared with Ford&apos;s official book of car noises. The bad news is Greg&apos;s truck is a Dodge. Elsewhere, Rollie&apos;s test drive turned eventful when he backed into a light pole and is on the run from a dealer with an insurance deductible. Also, David&apos;s cruise control is out of control when the headlights are on; Chella is pondering a life without third gear; and Sharon is wondering why so many men are driving around picking their noses. All this, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Reid wants to save his Audi&apos;s transmission by flushing it, but his mechanic thinks the gunk is the only thing keeping the tranny from self-destructing. Will Tom and Ray embrace the debris theory? Elsewhere, Colleen&apos;s dad used the "break brake-in&apos; theory" to insist he had to drive the family to the movies. Was this science or just a way to tell Colleen he thinks she&apos;s a stinko driver. Also, Melissa is relying on a rope to keep her driver&apos;s door shut; Katie wants to use white gas that&apos;s too old for her camp stove in her Corolla; and Tommy pulls out one of his most ingenious ideas to help David get away with buying only two snow tires instead of four. Of course, David not make it through winter, but does that make it any less brilliant? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Rick has lots of reasons to justify adding a supercharger to his Miata. Unfortunately, they&apos;re all harebrained. Will the wisdom of baseball legend Ted Williams help dissuade Rick, or does a mid-life crisis trump all? Speaking of harebrained, Cheryl&apos;s brother is driving around with a rotted gas tank, and the fuel lines re-routed to a tank in his trunk. Also, Tamara&apos;s family needs help saying goodbye to their beloved Vanagon; Mike be facing a winter without power steering; and Melissa&apos;s husband is about to learn what happens when you cheap out on snow tires. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Melissa Petersen returns with another helpful critique. But how can Tom and Ray be geeks and hippies at the same time? Elsewhere, Quentin can&apos;t decide whether to restore his grandfather&apos;s Dodge Dart Swinger (the most inaccurately named car ever?), or re-gift it to the nearest crusher. Also, Moon&apos;s trip to the Grand Canyon was marked by an argument with his wife over air conditioning; Bernadette is considering a career change from one non-profit to another by becoming a mechanic; and should Diane add a paint overcoat to her daughter&apos;s Jetta, or is this (yet another) dealer scam? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jake&apos;s car is growing hair on top and to make things worse, it clashes with the car&apos;s color. Did someone slip Rogaine into Jake&apos;s gas and does he need a paint job or a cream rinse to deal with it? Elsewhere, Nancy&apos;s 3-year old son gets carsick when she drives "the wiggly road", aka, The Pacific Coast Highway, but does fine when Dad&apos;&apos;s behind the wheel. Also, Jason&apos;s car has three problems and get three wrong answers; Mike agreed to pull his neighbor&apos;s engine, and is about to learn he&apos;s going to have to pull a lot more, too; and, Sally&apos;s dream car be trying to kill her. All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Rory&apos;s ego is in trouble, after he failed to siphone gas from his car to his lawn tractor. Has siphoning gotten more difficult, or is Rory just incompetent? Elsewhere, Tom doesn&apos;t know if it&apos;s worth cautioning his son about driving cross country in a pickup truck, if all he&apos;ll get in return in the "stunad stare". Also, Maggie&apos;s gauges stop working only when she drives by the Mall of America; Darlene&apos;s road trip from Colorado to San Francisco felt like she was floating on air, likely because she really was; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if marriage cured Ellen&apos;s fiance of his obsession with performance add-ons. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom&apos;s Pathfinder needs new shocks, and given that he&apos;s about to embark on a road trip with his mom, girlfriend, and dog, he&apos;d better buy the right ones. Elsewhere, Alan&apos;s undercover surveillance work has been a bit compromised by his over-active windshield wipers. Also Carolyn&apos;s husband insists on treating their automatic transmission as if it&apos;s a stick shift; a ton of clay have been too much for Charlie&apos;s Explorer to carry; and Bill tried to use his daughter&apos;s tights to replace a broken serpentine belt, but they flew apart. Were they the wrong size? The wrong color? And would Tom and Ray have done better as hairdressers than mechanics? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jeff&apos;s Isuzu Trooper needs a new engine, but he&apos;s worried that a transplant will change his car&apos;s very identity. Does a car have a soul, and does Jeff need a mechanic or an exorcist? Elsewhere, Helena and her husband found a dream used car with one idiosyncrasy—it only goes in reverse. Good thing it came with a spare transmission in the trunk. Also, Roe borrowed her friend&apos;s Civic for three months and was so protective of the clutch that she kept forgetting to release the parking brake; the one and only Melissa Petersen makes a startling admission about her dog&apos;s true feelings towards Ray; and guess what turned up in a government auction—Sonja Henie&apos;s tutu! All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, our all-time favorite neurological oddity: a Massachusetts man begins speaking with a French accent following an accident. Could a whack to the noggin make Tom and Ray speak like actual mechanics? Also, three tales of things that aren&apos;t where they&apos;re supposed to be. John&apos;s dipstick keeps popping out, Crystie dropped a nail into her gas tank, and Dana&apos;s friend has a piece of the Berlin Wall lodged in his dad&apos;s BMW&apos;s trunk. And, Julie "backed into a car that wasn&apos;t there" and didn&apos;t confess to her husband. Is it time to come clean? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ted put his carpentry skills to work by redirecting his van&apos;s leaky exhaust through a series of pipes outside the van. His pipe-shrouded van might scare off clients, and he have greatly increased the chances of setting the van on fire, but is Ted still worthy of a Click and Clack Genius award? Elsewhere, Jeff is concerned that his Eagle Scout son doesn&apos;t want to drive, but he want to give the kid another merit badge, for good sense; Peter has gotten half a dozen bad diagnoses for his truck&apos;s shifting problem—including floor mats—and be about to get one more; and are Tom and Ray leading practitioners of "Learned Ignorance"? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Elizabeth&apos;s Audi is going through an alternator a month. Is the problem inside her car, or are they being built by the wrong group of Tibetan monks? Elsewhere, Aron&apos;s Nissan is channeling the Three Stooges; Kristin learned there&apos;s no such thing as a free brake inspection; Ann&apos;s about to learn why she should never listen to her father — or her kids&apos; father — when it comes to cars; and Patti settles Tom and Ray&apos;s great Sleek Black Beauty bet with news on her mom&apos;s attempt to drive a Datsun from Texas to Massachusetts. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray venture far afield as they consider one listener&apos;s idea that could revolutionize elevator operations (within the confines of still going up and down)— if anyone can make heads or tails of it. Later, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if our hosts helped Jeff&apos;s breadmaker resume making loaves instead of hockey pucks. To mollify NPR, we&apos;ll also wrestle with a few car questions. Drea wants to know if steam cleaning the engine is really a good way to pamper her Nissan; Elizabeth&apos;s BMW&apos;s door locks have gone wacko and she can only get in the car if she grabs the handle at exactly the right moment; Evan&apos;s wondering what became of the golf ball her 3-year-old son stuck up the tailpipe; and do Paul&apos;s lug nuts have to be tightened following a religous code? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, between Being and Nothingness is—a loose heat shield? One listener suggests Tom and Ray&apos;s baffling car advice is actually the dawning of a new line of deep philosophical thought. Elsewhere, Mary Jane hopes the guys can help save her marriage by not answering her husband&apos;s call about his Ford Fairlane; Sandy need to be bribed to get a diagnosis for her noisy Accord; David parked his Civic in the garage for a week and now the parking brake is stuck; and Barry can&apos;t understand why his Mercedes is a bug magnet. Finally, why is Jeff&apos;s CD radio messing up his cruise control? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Everyone knows a joke is less funny if you have to explain it. But if the joke wasn&apos;t funny in the first place, it&apos;s not really a problem. So, this week on the Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray explain the origin of one of their favorites, a "full Chicago." In matters automotive, Caroline is concerned about her Toyota&apos;s low idle and her husband&apos;s insistence they wear bicycle helmets in the car for safety. Also, Sarah&apos;s car seems to have become a magnet for thieves and wayward trucks looking for something to hit; Bob is trying to imagine a life without power steering; Tom and Ray advise Jamie on how to fake a natural death for his Excel; and on Stump the Chumps we find out if John was triggering the Lardbutt Indicator in his wife&apos;s Golf. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>You send just one of your brother&apos;s heaps to the crusher, and you never hear hear the end of it. But this week on the Best of Car Talk, Patti&apos;s mom&apos;s attempt to drive her Datsun from Houston to Boston spare Ray from ever having to hear the phrase "sleek black beauty" again. Elsewhere, Casey&apos;s career making bagpipes be the only way to rid his Civic of the garter snakes that have taken residence. Also, Gloria&apos;s Jetta is losing power on the highway, and her work-around might get her killed; John have replaced the wrong "gizmachi" to try to get the raw gas smell out of his Town Car; and Maz hears birds chortling when she downshifts her Fiat. All this, plus the legendary Melissa Peterson letter, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, one listener corrects the record on what NPR&apos;s Sylvia Poggioli really says when Tom and Ray besmirch her network by their very presence. You share Sylvia&apos;s horror when you hear our hosts struggle to figure out why Patty&apos;s MG will only travel 2 feet at a time. Elsewhere, Wendy&apos;s broken air conditioner indicates her relationship also be busted; Deb threw her husband&apos;s BMW into park before coming to a full stop, and doesn&apos;t know if she should be more concerned about the resulting noises from the car or her spouse; and, Steven got cheers from his kids and a dope slap from his wife after driving his Trooper across a stream. How did the car respond? All this, plus a ringing defense of PhD&apos;s and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Andy loves waxing his car, but his friends tell him he&apos;s wasting his time. Has paint technology made waxing passe, save for the mental health benefits? Elsewhere, Diane thinks her husband&apos;s claim that BMWs have a unique aroma is a bogus attempt to justify his mid-life crisis; Melissa traded her car to her ex-husband for a rifle and a skiff, but he thinks he got ripped off; and Ed&apos;s solution to a sticky shifter give his insurance company an ulcer. Also, how one student&apos;s GPA plummeted after she listened to a single episode of Car Talk; and a new wieght loss plan that&apos;s guaranteed to work—the Geriatric Diet. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, genetics suggest that men inherit intelligence from their mothers, which as Tom and Ray postulate, leaves one likely source for the "Hey guys, watch this!" gene. And to prove that point, Josh in Montana is testing the theory by trying to find the source of his truck&apos;s rattling noise by examining the under carriage—while the truck is moving. Also, Sara can&apos;t figure out how her pet chicken survived a ride under the hood of her Tahoe; John the mechanic needs to know the labor rate for evil ex-girlfriends; Cathy&apos;s Sentra is sending her to the poor house; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Michael fixed his father-on-law&apos;s Town Car and inherited it in the process. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Meanwhile, Tama need to clear out the Old Spice aisle to get the stink out of her Jeep so she can sell it. Also, Steve can remove his Omni&apos;s key while the car is still in drive which is pretty cool, except for that time the car ran over him; Teri&apos;s Accord is making noise in a place where there&apos;s nothing that can make noise; and Jordan&apos;s Taurus introduces a new Car Talk motto, "They don&apos;t care what we say, and we don&apos;t care what they do."

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Ike wants to spend the summer restoring an old truck with his 15-year-old son. Will this be a memorable father-son experience for all the wrong reasons? Elsewhere, Lisa&apos;s white Rabbit convertible top has gone gray, despite the use of every cleaning chemical known to humankind. Also, Nancy is worried that two-footed driving be hereditary; Brent&apos;s Audi is leaking the most expensive oil on the planet; and the previous owner of Gary&apos;s Morris put in a positive ground. Is it really possible for wipers to run backwards? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Teddi&apos;s Camry screeches when she starts it. She&apos;s developed lots of techniques that seem to avoid the noise, but is she mistaking correlation for causation? Elsewhere, John&apos;s wife says he&apos;s triggering the Lardbutt Indicator in her Golf causing the horn to blare at random times, only when he&apos;s driving it. Also, mobile dog groomer Gwen needs to decide whether to repaint or replace her company van; Wendy&apos;s looking for a car she can work on herself to help her meet guys; and can Jeff use his camping stove fuel in his Civic in an emergency? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Barbara&apos;s husband is a burper. At the gas station, he insists on shaking the car to squeeze in a few extra drops. Will Tom and Ray help Barbara convince her husband to stop belching out wacko ideas? Elsewhere, Denise&apos;s friend is coming from Germany, with his Citroen (assuming it fits the carry-on bin), and planning to drive it from New York to Minnesota. Will he make it past the Hudson River? Also, Steve&apos;s Check Engine light comes on only when he parks at the Pentagon; Kailash&apos;s mechanic told him his Escort has "Break Squeak Syndrome," but Tom and Ray think this diagnosis has one "s" too many; and, (another) Barbara needs help retrieving the keys that fell behind her dashboard, along with the dozen or so household items she&apos;s unsuccessfully used to try to retrieve them. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Chip likes his neighbors, but they insist on warming up their cars for 20 minutes every morning, and the noise and smell are driving Chip crazy. A well-placed cherry bomb might convince them to stop, but is there a more peaceful solution at hand? Elsewhere, Tom started selling cars two weeks ago, and is worried about the potential side effects. Also, Jennifer chose the worst city possible to learn how to drive a stick shift; Bill and his wife are looking for a $700 car that says "eccentric" rather than "cheapskate"; and Jeff relocated from New Orleans to a few thousand feet above sea level. His car handled the move, but his bread maker is producing hockey pucks. Can Tom and Ray put some lift into Jeff&apos;s loaves? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dayton&apos;s speedometer only works occasionally. Tom&apos;s advice? Take the Zen approach, and do nothing. Might Ray consider Dayton&apos;s budget for speeding tickets while crafting his reply? Elsewhere, Missy&apos;s son is headed to college this fall and wants to take an Audi Quattro with him, to Our Fair City. Should Missy spend the summer trying to talk him out of it? Also, Scott and his father-in-law have different views on accelerating while shifting; Char&apos;s Mercedes dies if she drives for two hours with the sunroof open; and Mark wants to know if his Ford Tempo can survive hauling a trailer with all his worldly possessions from Dallas to Philadelphia. He might do better trying to get from Dallas to Fort Worth. And, in honor of Mother&apos;s Day, Elizabeth Magliozzi checks in on her boys&apos; undershirt status. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Wendy is worried that her mechanic&apos;s difficulty diagnosing her noisy Golf is affecting his mental health. Is a round of baked goods therapy the cure? Meanwhile, Robin is having her own issues with guilt after forsaking her regular mechanic and taking her Corolla to the dealer for its 30,000 mile service. Also, Jonathan doesn&apos;t know whether to celebrate or fear winning the argument with his wife over speed bumps; Tina&apos;s brake problem could be her ticket to stardom in Vegas; and Scott&apos;s uncle suggested he unplug his Accord&apos;s odometer to keep its mileage down. We probably don&apos;t need to tell you this, but Scott&apos;s uncle is a used car salesman. Will Tom and Ray advise Scott on how to do this, or call the Feds? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tamsen&apos;s mechanics are replacing lots of parts on her Super Beetle (and there weren&apos;t that many to begin with), but not the part that&apos;s causing the car to vibrate. Are they genuinely clueless or just using a dairy farm technique? Elsewhere, Dennis dreamed that someone gave him a &apos;66 Ford Fairlane. Will Drs. Magliozzi make a house call to help him interpret it? Also, Kathleen&apos;s trying to save miles on her leased car by "straightening the curves"; Johanna is moving into a teepee for the summer and is worried about her car washing away (we&apos;d be more concerned about the teepee); and Donna&apos;s husband hijacked her new Miata, insisting he needed to drive it to "break it in properly"; and we proudly unveil the Car Talk Listener Rebate Program. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ray recounts a dark day in Massachusetts history—when the powers that be decided his 16-year-old son was worthy of a driver&apos;s license. Elsewhere, it&apos;s planting season on Diane&apos;s parents&apos; farm and they&apos;d like her husband to remove the BMW with a blown engine residing there. Also, Nirav&apos;s Wrangler&apos;s horn blared at 5 AM and now won&apos;t honk at all. Might the angry neighbor with a sledge hammer and wire cutters be responsible? Ira&apos;s Jeep had one leaky injector, but he was told nature required him to replace all six; Tim can&apos;t turn his wipers off unelss he bangs on the steering column; and Michelle&apos;s husband gave her some bogus advice about not using the parking brake. How bogus? Depends on how likely he is to beat up two puny radio hosts. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, the junkyard refused to haul away Ruth&apos;s beloved Dodge Colt. So the big question is, does it have a future as an arboretum or a terrarium? Elsewhere, Alan&apos;s relocating from Dallas to Vermont and wants to know if his Bronco needs to be outfitted with anything other than snow tires and Bronko Nagurski long underwear. Also, Nathan learned an expensive lesson about what happens when you tow a boat in 5th gear; Jeff is prepared to strap someone to the hood to help diagnose his Grand Am&apos;s "arthritic knee" noise; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Dana&apos;s Jetta really was suffering from schmutz on the clutch. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Linda is suffering acute separation anxiety, after her dad sold the family&apos;s beloved Rambler to a neighborhood teen. Can Tom and Ray help Linda get closure or suggest a few semi-legal strategies to get the car back? Elsewhere, Rita&apos;s "soon to be ex-husband" says she should always use the parking brake, and she&apos;s convinced he must be wrong because she&apos;s dumping him. Also, Mike&apos;s attempt to show off his ability to shift into third gear cost him Reverse; Gamin&apos;s Civic is making noise ever since she drove through a deep puddle; and is there enough Prozac in the world to get Christine and her mom through driving lessons? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Gloria&apos;s mechanic told her not to put her car into reverse first thing in the morning. Does Gloria need to build a circular driveway so she can follow this advice or can it be consigned to the Land of Old Wives Tales. Elsewhere, LaDell just started selling cars and already made his first mistake, bragging about a car&apos;s torque without knowing what torque is. Can Tom and Ray help him avoid future faux pas? Also, Liberty&apos;s new motto be "Give me ball joints, or give me death"; ski bum Chris is wondering how to handle her truck which spent a cold winter abandoned in Chicago; and can Liz&apos;s truck handle her growing family of sled dogs? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Judith figures two mechanics would be the perfect test subjects for her voice-biometrics lie detector. But her choice of Tom and Ray might cause the machine to just give up. Elsewhere, Outdoor Studies major Ted is about to graduate and plans to drive his vintage Dodge van from upstate New York to Alaska. Ted might be studying a lot of the outdoors—waiting for tow trucks. Also, Cindy&apos;s car got really loud after she replaced the exhaust system; Justin&apos;s Civic has water pouring in through the speakers when it rains; and Christine&apos;s key is stuck in her ignition which has less urgency now that the car won&apos;t start. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray turn to the wisdom of Butch Cassidy to help settle a dispute between Erin&apos;s husband and friend over shifting. Then, the guys help James and his fiancee take on the Marital-Industrial Complex by registering for gifts at Louie&apos;s Lexus rather than Chafing Dishes R Us. Also, Bob loves the former police car he just bought but need to replace a part he doesn&apos;t believe exists; Anita&apos;s truck has developed a heavy breathing sound; and Eric is looking for the perfect vehicle for a family trip along the Al-Can Highway. Maybe he should be looking for four perfect vehicles? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Whitney&apos;s husband insists on waiting until the low fuel lights comes on before getting gas. Is he damaging their car, and even if he is, would curing this habit damage his psyche? Elsewhere, Tom thinks his mechanic is suffering from "Symmetry Neurosis" for insisting on replacing parts in pairs. Also, Ricardo had his car trucked from San Francisco to Boston and now its clutch is cooked; Dana loaned her Jetta to a friend and got it back with a new noise; and Howard&apos;s Lincoln is emitting a whooping noise when he gets of the car. Did he buy the extremely limited Three Stooges Curly Package? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Steve needs help adjusting to a life with four cylinders and cloth seats, after his recent divorce forced him out of his Ferrari and into a Camry. Elsewhere, Deirdre&apos;s mechanic has a hair-brained scheme to weld new teeth on her Volvo&apos;s flywheel. Is it worth doing, even if it&apos;s just for laughs? Also, Connie needs help choosing the right car for her road trip to Rio de Janeiro; Daniel needs to stop replacing distributor caps, and replace his mechanic, if he wants to find out why his Sentra stops running; Piali&apos;s best response to her squeaking steering wheel be a swear box; and is Lyle&apos;s strategy of putting a pizza box in front of the radiator a boooogus way to warm his car? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Brenda&apos;s shoulder belt got stuck in her jacket zipper effectively trapping her in her car. Embarrassing? Sure, but not as embarrassing as Tom and Ray&apos;s friend who tried to drive her car from the back seat. Elsewhere, Ben&apos;s band wants to take his vintage Volvo on tour from Seattle, and wants to know if he can book any shows beyond, say, Tacoma. Also, Albee wants to sell a sputtering and stalling LeBaron to his mother-in-law, which is probably one way to guarantee she never visits; Judy swears her Olds is making noise. Her mechanics are telling her she&apos;s crazy, but at least they&apos;re doing it politely; and Gretchen thinks she have gotten too good a deal from the guy who got the mud out of her Sentra. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Rick&apos;s diesel Rabbit ran out of fuel and the only liquid Rick had on hand was a bottle of scotch. Could he have poured the scotch into the tank or would Rick have been better off drinking it and waiting for the tow truck? Elsewhere, a tree fell on Murli&apos;s Corolla (we think it made a sound), and he doesn&apos;t know whether to replace the roof or have it straightened; Sally&apos;s steering column is sending smoke signals; and Kerry needs help navigating the "Pit of Despair", a giant water-filled pothole in her building&apos;s parking lot. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray helped Kathy lead her son to victory in the Pinewood Derby, and how much he lost by. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, despite the best efforts of every vice-grip holder in a 30-mile radius, Lyle can&apos;t move her truck&apos;s dipstick. Is her only option to turn the truck upside down and hope gravity does the trick? Meanwhile, the laws of space and time are being challenged in Colorado, where Ian&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s odometer is spinning backwards. Should she trade her car in before or after it hits negative numbers? Also, Jay&apos;s Civic was running perfectly until he attempted some DIY maintenance, and now the car is revving high and getting lousy gas mileage; Erin&apos;s turn signals fail if she turns on the high beams in the 3-tone Impala she inherited from her grandfather; and Steve poses the philosophical question, why do bad things come to cars in the threes, in the worst possible weather? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jim replaced a torn CV joint on one side of his Subaru and then decided to replace the other side, just so it wouldn&apos;t feel left out. Now, Jim&apos;s car is "undulating" on the highway. Is Jim&apos;s good deed going punished? Elsewhere, Carla can&apos;t figure out which of her brothers she shouldn&apos;t drive like, when it comes to shifting; Ainsley&apos;s bumper is being held on with epoxy and her husband won&apos;t let her take it through the car wash, fearing the bumper will be left behind; UPS driver Steve wonders why his colleagues all get new trucks and he&apos;s still driving a beater; and does Scott have a French horn player living under the hood of his Explorer? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom gets the rare opportunity to fail Physics a third time as he and Ray try to help Kathy "help" her son design his Pinewood Derby race car. Elsewhere, Bridget&apos;s car is making a whisking sound that&apos;s only a little less scary than Tom and Ray&apos;s attempts to mimic it; Pam&apos;s Volvo is smoking more than her husband and arousing the ire of the Amherst, VA police department; and Johnny&apos;s attempt to fix his Jeep require him to avoid wearing rayon pants. Also, new research that demonstrates the male brain&apos;s oscillation between pure genius, and pure incompetence. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, can Adrienne use her Saab to deliver hundreds of pounds of rocks for her husband&apos;s birthday, or does Adrienne have rocks in her head? Elsewhere, Sarah&apos;s Taurus smells like waffles and maple syrup, so unless she spilled any IHOP leftovers down the vents, she be shopping for a new engine or a new car. Also, Tracy and her dog both need help convincing her husband to use his brakes and abandon his "conservation of memomentum" theory; Jim&apos;s friends are trying to convince him his van wlll have an easier time starting if he turns on the lights before turning the key; Chris can spend a few hundred dollars to turn off his Mazda&apos;s EGR light or invest in official Click and Clack black tape; and Daniel Pinkwater weighs in on his Theory of Displaced Misery. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray invoke the teachings of Daniel Pinkwater to convince Mary Ann that a really dumb car decision could improve every other aspect of her life. Alas, the Pinkwater philosophy won&apos;t help Paul, who is learning an expensive lesson about what happens when you don&apos;t test drive an old van before buying. Elsewhere, Ron has noticed an epidemic of padiddles (cars with one headlight out) since a recent cold snap; Lesley is looking for an antifreeze that will actually work in an Alaska winter (without giving her veterinary practice new patients); and does Tommy suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Italian Male Malaise? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dana&apos;s Jetta jerks in 1st Gear, and Tom and Ray have a highly technical explanation. Elsewhere, Mark thinks his "straighten the curves" driving technique is more efficient and saves wear and tear. It&apos;s also driving his wife crazy, which be another plus as far as Mark is concerned. Also, Suzy checks in with the final report on her attempted drive across Mexico in a VW Vanagon; Andy felt like he was driving naked and after confirming he was wearing pants, determined his automatic seat belt wasn&apos;t so automatic anymore; and Joddy&apos;s (yes, that&apos;s how he spells it) Chrysler dealer says it will cost $300 to replace a missing nut, which is well, kinda nuts. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, a simple timing-belt question triggers an existential crisis as Kimberly&apos;s disagreement with her mom leads Ray to wonder why he has a co-host. Elsewhere, Veronica&apos;s husband wants to buy a vintage Land Rover to navigate the wilds of downtown Boston; Reed fears towing his wife&apos;s horse trailer will destroy his beloved Bronco; and Joe&apos;s about to get some very bad news about his Saab&apos;s transmission. Also, meet our friends Eddie and Edie Electron and find out why they&apos;re responsible for Michele&apos;s starting problem. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jackie&apos;s pet python&apos;s lunch disappeared into the vents of Jackie&apos;s Explorer. Not a big deal, right? Well, lunch was a live rat which has since deceased, but is still in the car stinking it up to high heaven. Elsewhere, Delena has decided that six years is long enough to live with an oil leak, so she&apos;s ready to have it addressed; Helen needs to stop and sniff the tailpipe to try to figure out what&apos;s leaking from her Odyssey; Rich need a team of FAA investigators to help decode the noise coming from the black box in his pickup; and, a tale of a Fiat&apos;s Christmas miracle. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, does anything say "I love you" more than a set of snow tires? Well, Patty thinks lots of things do, and is dismayed by her boyfriend&apos;s plan to gift her a set of tires for Christmas. Will Tom and Ray take Patty&apos;s side or thank her boyfriend for the idea? Also, we hear from Suzy, who was planning to drive from Carlsbad, California all the way across Mexico in a VW Vanagon. We say "was," because Suzy&apos;s only gotten to Texas, and the Vanagon is already making noises. Is this road trip doomed? And Laura&apos;s 20-year old-son put gravel in her truck&apos;s wheels and stuck coins down the vents. Should she be more worried about the truck or her son&apos;s habits? All this, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray grapple with a philosophical conundrum for the ages: if you have to choose between honesty and competence, who wins? Elsewhere, Judy&apos;s Mom got a book of New England home remedies that suggests leaving a blanket and light bulb under the hood; Dennis is looking for a universal sign he can use to let other driver&apos;s know he made a bonehead move; and Fran&apos;s daughter might be a little too enthusiastic about inheriting Grandpa&apos;s old Town Car, which she&apos;s dubbed The Party Barge. Also, what&apos;s a pastor to do when his car&apos;s emitting an embarrassing odor? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Suzy is planning to driver her parents across Mexico in a rebuilt VW Vanagon. We know Suzy won&apos;t need any stinkin&apos; badges, but are there any tools she can bring along to increase her chances of completing the trip to 15%? Elsewhere, Kathy&apos;s Mercedes&apos; wipers are so bad her kids have to lean out the window and play spotter whenever it rains; Biju can&apos;t stop falling asleep at 10:00 PM--at home or behind the wheel; and Ed learned he shouldn&apos;t try to change his car&apos;s fluids before his morning coffee. Also, Joann&apos;s Jeep has a leak, and so does Joann&apos;s professional ego because she runs a repair shop, and can&apos;t figure out where the water&apos;s coming in.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray have been called lots of things we can&apos;t repeat in polite company, but they&apos;ve never been more flummoxed than by high school student Lydia&apos;s insistence on calling them "sir." Is Lydia too polite to find out why the key keeps falling out of her car while she&apos;s driving? Elsewhere, Suzanne is concerned about the gas fumes emanating from the "other woman" in her husband&apos;s life, his Ford Model A, named Tootsie. Also, Faith&apos;s trusty Subaru has become a little less reliable since she drove it from Maine to Alaska; Romeo had a lot of fun peeling out in his Olds Cutlass, but will he still be laughing when he sees the repair bill; and a quick quiz to find out if you could have a future in the exciting world of car repair. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Paul&apos;s Jetta lost some of its Fahrvergnügen, so he tried to pep it up with a new set of spark plugs. Now the car is running worse. Did Paul need more than just plugs or did his mechanic assign the job to the wrong guy? Elsewhere, Joan and her friend are arguing over whether slower highway driving leads to longer engine life; Linda is concerned that Tom and Ray&apos;s "potato in the tailpipe" stalling technique could kill a dog that happened to lock the car doors; and did Helen&apos;s truck really lose 100 miles per tankful of gas, or was she suffering from Move Euphoria? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Tara has gone on a couple of dates with a medical student who&apos;s smart, really nice, and is living in a van in the school parking lot. Is there a van dweller psychological profile that should scare her off? Elsewhere, Peter&apos;s friend showed the limits of an MIT education by locking himself in Peter&apos;s trunk while trying to fix it; Carl&apos;s Altima has been making noise since he drove over a rock 6 months ago and his head is too big for him to look underneath to see what might be causing it; Stephanie&apos;s mechanic can&apos;t hear her Subaru&apos;s high-pitched whine so she need to find a dog to help diagnose it; and Katie&apos;s new used Volvo is great, except for her leg going numb while she&apos;s driving it. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, it&apos;s one thing to trust Tom and Ray with your car, but would you really want to rely on them for a problem with your airplane? Mort&apos;s willing to take the chance to find out why his Piper is having trouble re-starting after a flight. The fact that this problem occurs on the ground mollify our liability insurance carrier. Elsewhere, Sara got stuck in a drive-through car wash and can only get out of park by nudging her car from behind; Shirley thinks her husband is spending more to store his vintage Mustang than the car is worth; and Ed wants to try the "Johannesburg Jolt" to stop his cats from marking their territory on his car. All this, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray wrestle with a textbook case of Extreme Frugality. Susan&apos;s husband loves his old Volvo so much he refuses to use the windshield wipers so he won&apos;t wear out the motor. What&apos;s next? Preserving the brakes by not using them? Elsewhere, Jackie needs help deciding whether she should buy a beater car for the winter but her Dad has recused himself after a run of recommending lemons. Also, something be wrong with the air conditioning in Bill&apos;s Explorer (the smoke billowing from under the hood tipped him off); and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Carla&apos;s truck is still only able to climb the hills of Homer, Alaska in Reverse. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Amy&apos;s Isuzu dies whenever she drives down a certain street. Is it electrical interference, a government experiment, or is Amy living in a remake of "The Day the Earth Stood Still"? Elsewhere, Herb&apos;s mechanic told him to deal with his turbo&apos;s noise by turning down his hearing aid; David is using a clothespin to keep his choke in place; and if Tom and Ray can diagnose Cheryl&apos;s noise, a signed photo of Sonja Henie be on its way to Car Talk Plaza. Also, Anita&apos;s husband says it&apos;s dangerous for her to listen to the radio while her car is in the Accessory position, but he just be looking for a way to avoid our show. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Glen is looking for a cheap VW Cabrio, after his girlfriend Fluffy dumped him for a guy named Thor and took her car with her. Glen&apos;s friend suggested searching in backyards for a car with a blown engine. Is this likely to succeed, assuming Glen doesn&apos;t have access to Tommy&apos;s backyard? Elsewhere, Jeryldine&apos;s car is infested with arachnids, and the suggested remedies take up even more space than the creatures; Lacy&apos;s Accord is ejecting engine parts; and, Barry need a few gallons of extra virgin olive oil to get his Mazda out of his garage. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Lisa quieted her Civic so she could talk to the cute guy next door. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week, we continue celebrating (and apologizing for) Car Talk&apos;s 30th Anniversary on NPR, with some of our all-time favorite "out there" calls. Our roster includes space shuttle astronaut John, whose government vehicle had a slight hesitation problem at 17,000 miles per hour; Gail, the Most Wanted Tollbooth fugitive at the Betsy Ross Bridge; Dave from Bemidji, MN, whose road trip from Alaska included using a campfire grill to fix his catalytic converter; Will, whose old dog Moses "blew beets"; and the saga of one of our heroes, lawn chair pilot Larry Walters. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk&apos;s Field Guide to the North American Wacko.</description>

<description>Who better than Tom and Ray to solve a dispute between two brothers over a vintage Camaro? Well, lots of people, actually. But Cynthia wasn&apos;t able to reach any of them, so this week on The Best of Car Talk, she&apos;ll hope our heroes can bring peace to Thanksgiving this year. Elsewhere, Virginia&apos;s Honda keeps getting stolen and returned. She&apos;s resorted to drastic measures to protect it, but would she be better off just leaving the car unlocked and engine running? Also, John&apos;s Corvette&apos;s engine is misfiring, but John&apos;s hesitant to go to the dealer since the miss only occurs above 140 mph; and why did Bill&apos;s attempt to replace a broken belt with his daughter&apos;s tights fail? All this, plus a few unpublished titles from William Shakespeare, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Remember Heather and her cranky mechanic Helmut? Heather took her Volvo to Helmut for a stuck glove box and wound up spending $3000 for a new fuel system, only to have her car begin dying at high altitudes. This week on The Best of Car Talk, Heather returns for a round of Stump the Chumps and we find out how much of a dummkopf Helmut was. Elsehwere, Lori&apos;s boyfriend has begun collecting old cars but can&apos;t drive any of them due to his poor vision. Will Tom and Ray help Lori convince him to try a different hobby? Also, Carol&apos;s mechanic says her Mazda&apos;s bad gas mileage is due to too many drivers; and Tom and Ray need to resort to hypnosis to diagnose Joel&apos;s Mercedes&apos; snore. All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, we hear from Tom and Ray&apos;s all-time #1 nemesis, Melissa Peterson. Years after her first missive, Melissa wants to remind the guys that she (and her dog) still hate them, but would they mind giving her some potentially life saving advice? Elsewhere, Eric&apos;s horn started blaring in he middle of the night, and he resorted to a hammer to silence it. So now he&apos;s got a busted horn and still doesn&apos;t know what set it off. Also, Pat&apos;s Lumina is running out of gas with several gallons still in the tank; Farrah&apos;s VW is blowing hot air non-stop; and Suzi&apos;s Porsche has become a great conversation starter with her male colleagues, but she can&apos;t answer any questions to keep the conversation going. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Vern&apos;s sister-in-law&apos;s husband accused him of wrecking the engine in his Windstar by adding too much oil. On a scale of 1 to 10, how guilty should Vern feel? And does their tenuous connection on the family tree drive the guilt meter into negative numbers? Also, tales of VW Bugs: Maureen&apos;s caught on fire, and she&apos;s hoping for some encouragement that it won&apos;t happen again, while Wendy is wondering if the one she&apos;s been gifted by her parents can make it from Kansas to Washington. Also, a close call at Car Talk Plaza—how our Producer Dougie&apos;s laziness have saved his life. All this and more, this week on The Best Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Amanda is getting married in a few days, and has one last item on her To-Do list—convincing her fiancé to get rid of his truck. Should she just throw the keys instead of a bouquet? Elsewhere, Glen&apos;s wife is a parish priest in need of a new car, and a cure for her habit of driving 120 mph. Also, Karen learned why you should let sleeping cars lie after her perfect Civic started running lousy following a tune-up; Jerry&apos;s taillight is exploding every few weeks; and our on-call Physicist Wolfgang helps settle the great keyless remote dispersion debate. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Ray takes Male Answer Syndrome to a whole new level, trying to explain why Dave&apos;s keyless remote works better when Dave points it at his chin rather than the car. Is the Great Dispersion Theory utterly brilliant, or utterly booooogus? Elsewhere, Andy dropped a straw in his dad&apos;s Buick&apos;s gas tank, and somehow "forgot" to mention it. Now that dad&apos;s car is running lousy, does Andy need to &apos;fess up? Also, Doris need to dump her mechanic after he sent her away with a pegged temperature gauge; and in a follow-up, we hear from Elisa&apos;s boyfriend Tracy and find out if he accepted her mom&apos;s offer of a new car if he popped the question. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Katherine&apos;s new job got off to a bumpy start (literally!), when she rear-ended her boss&apos; shiny new car on her first day. Katherine has been eyeing a new car herself, but should she wait for her first performance review? Meanwhile, Elisa&apos;s parents say they&apos;ll buy her a new car if she marries her live-in boyfirend. Should she accept, or will she be opening the door to future car-motivated life events? Also, Spencer couldn&apos;t resist the urge to touch his lugnuts, and found them to hot handle; Brett gets a shock every time he gets out of his Camry; and what does your Oreo cookie strategy say about your pesonality? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, after years of ranting and raving about bad drivers, Tommy makes a shocking confession. What previously unthinkable driving sin did he commit, and why? Meanwhile, Tommy&apos;s erstwhile soulmate Rob drives like a tortoise in a land of rabbits and is looking for a visual cue to keep his fellow motorists&apos; blood pressure down. Elsewhere, Sherry loves her new Town Car but can&apos;t fit a bike rack on it. Alas, her husband isn&apos;t wild about Sherry&apos;s proposed solution—a used stretch limo. Also, Joanne is trying to teach two teenagers to drive a stick shift without needing family counseling; Bert&apos;s 280z died on his way home from a successful wild boar hunt; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Rich still has to push his Passat into his garage to get it started. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Katie&apos;s roommate&apos;s pseudo-scientific explanation for getting her Civic&apos;s door stuck on a sidewalk struck her as bogus, so she&apos;s turning to two pseudo MIT grads. Can Tom and Ray separate truth from bogosity? Elsewhere, Tim and Pam need a ruling on whether his joyride on a washboard road crushed her Saturn&apos;s engine mounts. Also, can Gene&apos;s Corolla survive 100,000 miles with a leaking fuel pump and axle seal, and a dope slap reminder to check both daily; Flo&apos;s Mazda has bad universal joints or jockey shorts that are too tight; and after two years of driving with a wobbling rear wheel has Keller&apos;s luck run out? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Steve left a fresh turkey in his car for a week, and well, things don&apos;t smell so fresh anymore. Will any combination of soap, air freshener, and bad cologne get the stench out, or does Steve need to call Vinny the Torch? Elsewhere, Michael doesn&apos;t know if he should be worried about a couple of green spark plugs; Maggie&apos;s son has fallen in love with a hand-me-down Buick Regal that could kill him; and Linda is about to relocate from Ohio to the Virgin Islands. She wants to know if she should bring her Corolla. Tom and Ray want to know if Linda can fit them in her suitcase. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week, The Best of Car Talk kicks off with some of our favorite Country song titles. Can anything top, "I&apos;d Rather Pass a Kidney Stone Than Another Night With You"? Then it&apos;s off to Maui, where Jeff would be advised to stop bragging about the weather if he wants to find out why his brake pedal is sinking to the floor. Elsewhere, Inga is wondering which of her several mistakes caused her parked car to lurch down hill; Matt&apos;s brother talked him into a DIY timing belt change on his Acura, and a month later, the car still isn&apos;t running right; Bryan would like his vintage pickup truck to handle like a Dodge Viper; and can Stephanie&apos;s Corolla survive a cross-country trip?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ellen&apos;s Civic has been in three crashes, vandalized nine times, and had a tree fall on it, all of which has somehow convinced Ellen the car is cursed. If she tries to sell it, does she have to divulge these mishaps? Elsewhere, Keller&apos;s Beetle is missing its front passenger floorboard. Will a "found" street sign and a friend with an oxyacetylene torch cover the hole, without a 911 call? Also, Peter&apos;s Jeep knows when he&apos;s in a hurry, and chooses those moments to not start; Sandra accidentally pumped five gallons of diesel into her Odyssey, and can Warren really live a happy life without a working oxygen sensor in his Camry?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Cynthia is so convinced her gas mileage improves when she gets her oil changed, she bet her boss 100 bucks. If she can&apos;t win on technical grounds, might Tommy the Philosopher King be able to bail her out? Elsewhere, Linda be on firmer scientific footing by claiming her husband&apos;s "wah-wah" pedal driving style is doing more harm than good. Also, Joyce&apos;s hood won&apos;t open, and given the overall condition of her car, an air chisel might be the right tool; Scott is looking for eco-friendly windshield washer fluid, and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray helped Laurie&apos;s Pathfinder lose its nickname, "Wobble Butt". All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Slackers of the world, unite! Ah, never mind, that&apos;s probably too much effort. But this week The Best of Car Talk pays tribute to those dedicated to avoiding the rat race. In matters automotive, Liz&apos;s husband really wants to celebrate the end of his medical residency by buying a used Porsche, but Liz is worried the repair bills will negate any salary increase he&apos;s about to receive; Julie is wondering if her Accord&apos;s electrical problems are related to the series of "encounters" (accidents) she&apos;s had; and Marc&apos;s gas mileage appeared to increase by 20 percent after he left the gas cap off. Should OPEC be worried? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>You&apos;re driving down a long hill in San Francisco. Your brakes fail and there&apos;s a stop sign at the bottom. What do you do, aside from uttering every prayer in the book? This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray offer two suggestions, one of which might actually help avoid a big hospital bill. Elsewhere, Robin loves her Tourismo, even though it needs more than $1000 worth of repairs and it&apos;s causing a family rift. Is it time for her to kiss it goodbye? Also, Alex thinks her boyfriend&apos;s technique have led to the premature demise of his Jetta&apos;s shifter; Finley needs help convincing his friend to baptize his new truck by hauling some manure; and after losing a lot of money to the IRS, will Ruth have to lose even more to her mechanic because of her Achieva&apos;s coolant leak? All this, plus a round of Stump the Chumps, and more--this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Savannah wants to decorate her Plymouth Sundance because, well, they couldn&apos;t make it look worse, could they? Is she going to appear even more wacko by asking Tom and Ray for advice? Elsewhere, Peter wish that whining sound coming from his car is his mother in law after he finds out what it&apos;s going to cost to make it go away; over in Germany, Steve is wondering whether his Tracer can survive keeping up with the BMWs going 100 on the Autobahn; and Richard is so desperate to find out why his cab has vapor lock, he&apos;s willing to kick out a passenger so he can talk to Tom and Ray. All this, plus one listener&apos;s fond Puzzler memory, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Hannah is about to graduate from Smith College and move in with her boyfriend. Does cohabitation extend from their apartment to his Ford Explorer? But first Hannah wants to counter our pal Leah&apos;s thoughts on all-women colleges. Elewhere, Marni wants to pay tribute to her departed dad by pouring some of his ashes into his beloved Corvette&apos;s gas tank; Su wants to use a hair dryer to straighten her dented fender; and is the whirring noise Eric is hearing the death-bed cry of his Saab&apos;s turbo?

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Laurie&apos;s Pathfinder earned the unfortunate nickname "Wobble Butt" because its rear end rocks from side to side. Can Tom and Ray calm Wobble Butt down and save it from further embarrassment? Elsewhere, Bob wants to know just how wacko his brother in law is for proposing adding duct work to improve the heat in Bob&apos;s mom&apos;s car. Also, Ellen&apos;s dad scolded her for having too many keys on her key ring; Chris got a little aggressive with his Dremel tool on his Camry; and Ray shares the joys (and terrors) of teaching middle school, while trying to help Susannah strengthen her anemic windshield wiper squirt. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, our favorite depressed college freshman, Leah, checks in with an update on her whereabouts—physical and emotional. Did she adjust to life on campus and follow Tom and Ray&apos;s advice to embrace failure? Elsewhere, Andy wants to know if electronic gizmos can improve his Suburban&apos;s gas mileage to, say, 5 miles per gallon; Chris&apos; Belvedere is growing flowers in the front seat and stinks of blue cheese; and the severity of Dan&apos;s coolant loss be directly tied to his religious practices.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Merriam-Webster helps answer the second most-asked question in Car Talk history: which brother is "Click" and which is "Clack." Unfortunately, they can&apos;t the answer the most-asked question: How did these jerks get on the radio in the first place? Elsewhere, Lee&apos;s mechanic told him he has a cracked "whoop tube," which or not refer to Lee&apos;s Town Car; a wayward binky has Marietta&apos;s driver&apos;s seat stuck in a bad spot; and traveling musician Valerie can&apos;t decide whether to dump the Dodge van that tows her trailer in favor of a Cadillac—sounds like a no-brainer to us! Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Wendy used the snorkel test to figure out why her husband is fogging up her car. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, if Art passes his AMC Concord onto his 16-year-old son, is he setting the kid on a life path of collecting junk cars? In other words, Art wants to know what Tommy&apos;s first car was. And worse, would the Concord doom his son to no social life? Elsewhere, James is about to relocate to Haiti, but needs a car with high ground clearance. His Honda Civic not fit that description. Also, Wendy&apos;s husband is fogging up her car; Troy&apos;s VW sounds "satanic" at 1500 RPM, and Mary Rawson&apos;s friend offered to fix her brakes, but wants to be more than just friends. If she stops his advances, can she expect her car to stop? All this, plus the bright side of an expensive diagnosis, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jim thought he had a disaster on his hands after he left his gas cap off during a rain storm, but his pal came to the rescue by pouring mothballs into the gas tank. Can Tom and Ray give any explanation for why the mothballs got Jim&apos;s truck running? Meanwhile, Ray&apos;s got a theory about Heather&apos;s Jeep&apos;s popping noise that win points for creativity and bogosity. Also, Patrick hopes the guys can help him design the perfect soapbox derby car; Ann needs assurance that putting a new engine in her beloved Fuego isn&apos;t the most ridiculous idea ever; and has one of our listeners identified the true scent of a man? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Stella bought matching Monteros for her kids but dumped one because it spent more time in the shop than on the road. Should she be worried about the second Montero? Who better to weight the chances there&apos;s one good brother and one evil brother than Tom and Ray? Elsewhere, Heather has taken to calling her Jeep "Clunking Matilda"; Abe has an idea to navigate traffic in Our Fair City that get him to work faster (but with a fat lip); and can Anne risk one more road trip in her overheating Subaru before it blows up? All this, plus a round of Stump the Chumps and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week, the Best of Car Talk kicks off with a proposal that could revolutionize snow measurement, if it wasn&apos;t completely bogus. Later, the bogosity continues as Tom and Ray try to explain why Anne&apos;s dashboard gauges all stopped working after she filled up her gas tank at a Shell station—twice! Also, Kay&apos;s 38 year old daughter left mom&apos;s Explorer running all night, and Kay&apos;s wondering if she needs to blow out the car&apos;s engine or the cobwebs in her daughter&apos;s brain; 14-year old Matthew&apos;s struggles to wash his parents&apos; car could be a valuable life lesson in how to get out of doing chores forever; and will Rush ever be able to get the smell of rancid butter out of his Land Rover? All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Remember Rebecca from a few weeks ago, whose anal-retentive dad insisted she keep detailed records of her gas mileage in his book? This week, Dad has his say. Topher explains the book&apos;s origins in a Datsun 510, and what it will take for Rebecca to free herself from book duty. Elsewhere, Scott have to decide whether he wants to be right or be happy, as he and his wife disagree on how to use their truck&apos;s 4-wheel drive; Art&apos;s wife drove home from an oil change missing one small ingredient—the oil; and Judy&apos;s getting good at holding up her car&apos;s hatchback with her head, but would like to get it to stay up on its own. And, what happens when a computer traffic model tries to understand Boston drivers? All this and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>You&apos;ve no doubt heard Tom and Ray warn callers about the danger of wheels falling off their cars. Well, this week on The Best of Car Talk, Mike&apos;s wheel fell off—twice! Happily, he lived to tell the tale. Can Tom and Ray help prevent Strike Three? Elsewhere, Carl&apos;s daughter drove from Boston to Colorado, and swears her truck added gas along the way; Father John has decided to splurge on a Miata, and doesn&apos;t know if he&apos;ll get the best deal with his clerical collar on or off; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Alison&apos;s starting problem was really caused by a cracked breather, or if her mechanic had a cracked skull. Also, could listening to Car Talk really be good for your health? (Aside from the migraines and waves of nausea). All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, how do you handle a slightly anal retentive Dad who insists on keeping verrrry thorough car records? If you&apos;re Rebecca, you ignore Dad&apos;s beloved gas mileage book, tell Dad what you really think, and then call on Tom and Ray to try to get Dad to re-open his wallet. Elsewhere, should Carl try quieting his Rolls Royce by bending the door frame, or splurge for official Rolls duct tape? Also, Jane fears her mechanic have purged her of $87 with a bogus repair; Ben&apos;s girlfriend thinks he needs to factor wind chill into warming up his Rabbit; and Tom and Ray ponder how one sign with two simple words could lead to a utopian society. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Joyce&apos;s mild-mannered husband teaches meditation by day, but when he gets behind the wheel, he turns into a cross between Mario Andretti and Tony Soprano. Is it the car, the traffic, or does Joyce&apos;s husband have a dark side? Elsewhere, Andrew is concerned about his washer fluid lacking testosterone; Catherine has lived five years with a buzzing oil pressure indicator; and Aaron&apos;s Impala now takes off like it&apos;s dragging a ton of bricks. Also, Jim is worried he be a Fire Starter, after his battery and muffle both exploded. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Martin&apos;s love for his Cadillac has him concerned that he might actually be older than his Dad; Tony is sleeping on the sofa after his failed attempt to fix his wife&apos;s starting problem; and Sarah can only enter her car through the trunk, since the doors are frozen shut. Also, does the ECS light in Ilsa&apos;s Subaru mean "Expect Catastrophe Soon"? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Peterson is afraid to put air in his tires. Is he doomed to depending on the kindness of strangers with pumps, or can Tom and Ray help cure him—or at least outfit him properly in case there is an explosion? Elsewhere, towing be Dave&apos;s best option for transporting his beloved LeMans cross-country, because the car could fall off somewhere in Nebraska; Hanz can&apos;t decide if his wife&apos;s behavior at stoplights is utterly brilliant or utterly wacko; and Elizabeth be asking too much from her Volvo. Is shutting down when she turns on the wipers really such a big deal? All this, plus a world record for parking in a small space and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, is Phil&apos;s Buick Roadmaster making noise because of a steering problem or because he needs to make 20-point turns to navigate the narrow streets of Our Fair City? Elsewhere, Fred doesn&apos;t know whether he should listen to his mechanic or his FSTB (Future Son-in-Law To Be) on how to start the Alfa that&apos;s been sitting in his garage for a year. Will siding with the mechanic doom Fred&apos;s daughter&apos;s marriage? Also, Steve&apos;s driver&apos;s window glare screen is now a stuck-in-the-door glare screen; Alison&apos;s Golf be suffering from a "cracked breather" and "achin&apos; plugs"; and is Judy&apos;s Escort sending smoke signals that it won&apos;t make it to the moon?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mary loaded her Mustang&apos;s trunk with compost two months ago. Her husband says it&apos;s rotting the floor, but Mary wants to keep the compost all winter for ballast. One added wrinkle: Mary got the Mustang because her husband works for Ford—at least, for the time being. Elsewhere, Carla would love to escape from Alaska for a bit, but the fact that her truck will only drive backwards is making it difficult. Also, can Kathy figure out her Stratus&apos;s burnt popcorn smell without asphyxiating her sons? And is Justin&apos;s engine making noise, or is he just hearing people laughing a him for driving an old Beetle? All this, plus a plea for more civil Hate Mail, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, we thought nobody could be more devoted to an old heap than Tommy, but then we met Lita who has written a poem about her Monte Carlo—we&apos;re just relieved she didn&apos;t try to rhyme anything with "rust bucket." Elsewhere, Steve moved to Chicago for a job and a girlfriend. He lost both, but he&apos;s most confused about why his Acura was the only car not towed from a party. Also, the holiday season brings good cheer and the annual squeak to Betsy&apos;s Town and Country; Kate&apos;s temporary fix for her frozen door locks is hilarious, and incredibly dangerous; and, did the hottest man in show business set Melinda&apos;s radio on fire? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Evelyn wants to know why a bolt of lightning spared her car and struck the road 20 feet away instead. Tom and Ray think Evelyn should just say a few kind words to the deity of her choice and move on, but will nonetheless offer a pseudo-scientific answer that&apos;s guaranteed to have MIT demanding its diplomas back. Elsewhere we find out if Bob&apos;s wife&apos;s car survived sucking a sock into the engine on Stump the Chumps; Gary&apos;s steering noise is scaring away his girlfriends; and did Barbara do more damage to her husband&apos;s truck, or her marriage, by driving a mile without any oil? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, can Ray grant one listener&apos;s Christmas wish by snorting less? And why can&apos;t Bob stop laughing about his Geo&apos;s starting problem? Elsewhere, Alan&apos;s Lincoln is starting to sound eerily like his mother; Karen&apos;s Caravan&apos;s dashboard is telling her she&apos;s always going 120 miles per hour on an empty gas tank; Steph wants to tempt the Blowout Gods by removing his Miata&apos;s spare tire so he&apos;ll have more trunk space; and Ariel is thinking of buying her first car and is wondering what level of protection she needs to bring to the dealer. Will a Rottweiler do or a big guy named Bruno? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Bob is worried his car have a permanent case of athlete&apos;s foot (or worse) after a sock got sucked into the engine. Find out how the sucking transpired and whether Tom and Ray can stop laughing long enough to ease Bob&apos;s fears. Elsewhere, Patty&apos;s Accord began mooing at her. Is her best option to try milking it? Also, Elizabeth came home from Thanksgiving to discover her Volvo&apos;s windows permanently fogged; Marlene got talked into buying an electric anti-rust device for her new car; and Mike re-think his desire for a "heavy duty" clutch after he hears Tom and Ray&apos;s tale of the customer known as Mr. Heavy Duty and his enlarged left foot. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, one listener postulates that a non-essential repair on an old car creates a parallel universe where everything else starts to break. Sorry, but for proof, you have to tune to the Sci-Fi Channel. Elsewhere in the land of semi-wacko theories, Mark was told he could use rice to clean a carburetor, and Joyce&apos;s boyfriend insists on leaving his Taurus&apos; trunk open overnight to keep it dry. Also, can Stephanie blame her mom for killing her Subaru&apos;s clutch, and is Mike&apos;s snowblower really not starting because it&apos;s too cold? And, John&apos;s mechanic ran into the age-old dilemma: Is it better to admit stupidity or gaslight the customer? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mike and his sons are about to embark on a two-year around the world sailing voyage, but the vintage Land Rover Mike&apos;s been restoring won&apos;t be much use at sea. Should he sell it or will late-night TV provide the perfect storage solution? Elsewhere, Lisa&apos;s wondering how much restitution she&apos;s entitled to for allowing her husband to buy a used Corvette; Charlotte&apos;s daughter spent $300 on a truck and have overpaid; and Arnie&apos;s Accord&apos;s harmonic balancers won&apos;t stay balanced. Also, Tom and Ray need to consult Junk &amp; Wagnalls&apos; encyclopedia to diagnose Sandy&apos;s hum. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week, The Best of Car Talk kicks off with the tale of one man&apos;s descent to Dante&apos;s supplemental Circle of Hell, the local health club, where he is at the merciless hands of his personal trainer, Tanya. Then we&apos;re off to Virginia, where Shelia&apos;s Maxima smells like someone burned her dry cleaning. Elsewhere, Ethan&apos;s preparing to sell his truck, which was struck by lightning. Should he advertise it as "pre-disastered" or keep quiet? Also, from the don&apos;t-try-this-at- home department, Marty&apos;s dad got their vintage car started by sucking gas through the exhaust with a shop vac, and he still has his eyebrows! All this and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, gather round for the greatest road trip story ever told. Dave and his girlfriend drove from Alaska to Minnesota in an overheating Chevy Cavalier with an old campfire grill jammed into the catalytic converter, a crescent wrench with no sockets, and one big zit on Dave&apos;s forehead. In more mundane matters, Patrice&apos;s VW bus won&apos;t start, John Mark&apos;s backseat passengers are getting their feet soaked when he makes a turn, and Alana&apos;s gas tank is spitting fuel back out after she fills it. Also, how should Rich wake up a Buick that&apos;s been napping for four years, and is the threat of fire enough to convince Jim that replacing his tailpipe might count as a "necessary repair"? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Leah is contemplating the meaning of life and writes to Car Talk seeking answers. (Clearly more competent talk show hosts were busy!) Can Tom and Ray set her straight and help poor Leah find happiness? Meanwhile Hope&apos;s massive mutt has taken to riding on top of her pickup, and Paul&apos;s daughters are annoyed at his selective hearing. Will they hate dear old dad even more if he follows Click and Clack&apos;s advice? All that and more, in this week&apos;s automotively therapeutic episode of The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Sue&apos;s boyfriend is afraid to get in the car with her due to her long history of accidents, near misses, and traffic violations. Sue insists she&apos;s a safe driver, so a full-scale Car Talk intervention be necessary. Elsewhere, Robin thinks her VW&apos;s steering problem calls for an exorcist, but Tom and Ray say an arsonist be more helpful; Joe need to choose between a bungee cord and a 2x4 if he doesn&apos;t want to spring for a new transmission; and can Randy just keep adding a quart of oil to her Civic and live her life? Depends on whether her life involves driving the car! All this, plus more than you ever wanted to know about the hazards of adding urine to a radiator. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Andy&apos;s car overheated in the desert. With no water on hand, his girlfriend convinced him to use the only liquid available. We&apos;re bordering on TMI here, so we&apos;ll just say that Andy is now worried about said liquid&apos;s acid causing corrosion. Elsewhere, Judy and her Volvo just moved from Los Angeles to Chicago. What does she need to do to winterize her car, and herself? Also, Christian&apos;s clutch problems are threatening his career in pizza delivery; Magica&apos;s husband dropped a razor blade in the airbag compartment and thinks it&apos;s not a big deal; and should Louella risk her safety and sanity by teaching her teenage daughters how to drive stick shift? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Matt&apos;s bad day got a little worse when his Volvo fell off the tow truck that was hauling it from an accident. Will Tom and Ray&apos;s vast experience dropping cars help Matt figure out if his is still safe to drive? Elsewhere, should Jackie go braless when washing her car? We&apos;re talking about the car&apos;s bra here, not Jackie&apos;s. Also, Peter thinks he has a theremin player living in his car; Barb&apos;s smart-aleck son actually be smarter than she thinks; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Victoria bought cars for her three sons and opted for a career in flower arranging over business school.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Joe&apos;s brother-in-law collects heaps. This wouldn&apos;t be a problem, except the cars wind up in Joe&apos;s backyard.

Elsewhere, Sherry thinks her temperature gauge is going through menopause; Roseanna borrowed her friend&apos;s Subaru for the summer and fears she be responsible for its new noise; and Klaus need to learn how to drive his car with the engine off.

<description>Move over Heisenberg! This week on the Best of Car Talk, one listener&apos;s new theory on Tom and Ray&apos;s ability to alter reality. Elsewhere, Anthony thinks his cheapo tires are making noise. His solution? Swap them with his wife&apos;s tires. Will Tom and Ray have a suggestion that won&apos;t land Anthony in divorce court? Also, Crash&apos;s Mazda is making him live up to his nickname by wandering all over the road; Kimberly is tired of having to whack her Subaru&apos;s starter; Dora has become a reluctant member of the Alternator of the week club; and does a cleaner car lead to a bigger mechanic&apos;s bill? All this, plus some words to live by and lots more, this week on The Best of car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Stu&apos;s girlfriend Carla accidentally added engine oil to his beloved ZX&apos;s power steering. So why are Tom and Ray asking Carla if she wants to dump Stu?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Nancy doesn&apos;t fully trust her mechanic so she&apos;s throwing around car jargon to bluff him into thinking she knows more than she does. But, her vocabulary has run dry. Will the official Click and Clack Thesaurus come to her rescue? Elsewhere, Greg&apos;s truck&apos;s wiring has become lunch for critters and the only way to save it require giving up his beloved garage woodshop. Also, Kara&apos;s white-water rafting company have to do the unthinkable and switch to automatic transmissions for their trucks; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray knocked their heads together well enough to diagnose Debra&apos;s truck&apos;s knocking sound.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, distilled water be too hungry for John to use it in his radiator. Will Ray&apos;s explanation of the hungry water theory help clarify things, or as usual, only further obfuscate matters? Elsewhere, Linda&apos;s husband proudly claimed to have "fixed" her Volvo—by chopping off its roof. Now is it safe for use as anything other than a planter? Also, Kunal wants to give his horn testosterone treatments; Diana&apos;s van could be a new form of germ warfare; and on Stump the Chumps we find out if Liz found her gas leak, and the perfect jumpsuit. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dennis&apos; friend told him the best way to charge a low car battery is by turning on all the accessories. Does this earn immediate entry into the Wacko Theory Hall of Fame? Elsewhere, Julieta&apos;s boyfriend is blaming her driveway for his Camry&apos;s starting problem, which can only be cured by the correct curse words; Molly would like a little less cowbell in her Altima; and Gail explodes the myth that women don&apos;t play practical jokes. Also, how did a rental car&apos;s exhaust suck in Mike&apos;s daughter&apos;s shirt? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, did Christy destroy her Dad&apos;s car 15 years ago by putting black tape over a flashing temperature light— and then continuing to drive? And is Dad ready to forgive and forget? It&apos;s one of our all-time favorite auto-familial disputes. Elsewhere, Andy got talked into replacing his front brakes to help stop a noise coming from the rear; Nancy&apos;s husband says she&apos;s risking death by keeping her air conditioning on recirculate; and should Mickey be concerned that she&apos;s on her 4th consecutive boyfriend who drives an &apos;82 Honda? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Karlene&apos;s mechanic diagnosed her Explorer&apos;s annoying squeak as "an annoying squeak," with no suggestions for quieting it. Can Tom and Ray do perhaps just a wee bit better? Also, Ed need to resort to healing crystals to start his son&apos;s Taurus; Stan thinks his wife&apos;s aggressive air-conditioning use pop a belt; and Larry has a chance to take part in a wonderful bonding experience with his 14-year old son, and is looking for any way to get out of it!

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Bill parked his rental car on a beach, and discovered the next morning that the tide had rolled in—to the car. He&apos;s bailed the water, but hasn&apos;t told the rental company. Should he &apos;fess up? Elsewhere, on a scale of 1 to10, how stupid should Ryan feel about getting talked into an engine shampoo when he took his car for an oil change? How about 11? And, is a lucky doughnut enough to keep Tamatha&apos;s brakes from burning up for a third time? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray fulfill one listener&apos;s dream, while creating nightmares for everyone else, with a one-time only performance of the barbershop classic "Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby." Assuming the FCC lets us get through the rest of the show, Mary wants to sell her Accord, but it needs $500 of repairs. Should she get it fixed, divulge the problems to a potential buyer, or say nothing? And, how crazy is she for thinking she&apos;ll get a good answer from two mechanics? Also, can Steph&apos;s Subaru haul her sailboat and wine collection 1300 miles without dying, and more importantly, without ruining the wine? And, is Caroline&apos;s poor clutch technique destroying her relationships? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Bill&apos;s broken odometer fixed itself, right after Bill dreamed it was working. Will Tom and Ray have a mechanical explanation, a metaphysical explanation, or (most likely) a boooooogus explanation? Elsewhere, Toby wants her husband to get rid of her old BMW, but he&apos;s proving as immovable as the car; Sally is getting half her husband&apos;s mileage, and hopes it&apos;s not because she&apos;s buying cheap gas from Rotten Robbie; and Derek&apos;s dog would really appreciate it if Derek could get his Impreza to stop lunging forward. All this, plus a round of Stump the Chumps, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, can Cathy drive her dog 2,000 miles to summer camp in a truck without AC, or should she spend big bucks to cool all involved? Elsewhere, Dorothea&apos;s dealer changed her belts, and now her car is shrieking. Does she need a big lawyer, or a big stick? Also, Richie&apos;s dual oil system proves the adage, "The stingy man spends the most."; Tom and Ray ponder whether members of the Witness Protection Program get to hang out with each other; and did you know William Shakespeare was Italian? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Wyatt holds Tom and Ray responsible for the worst eight months of his life, and not because they gave him bogus car advice! It&apos;s a tale of woe and intrigue that ends with an almost cross-country escape in a VW Microbus. Elsewhere, Cynthia&apos;s kids want her to dump her beloved Subaru. Should she go along, if they give her a new BMW for Mother&apos;s Day? Also, Ben took his parents&apos; Land Rover for a joy ride that ended in a cloud of smoke; Helen&apos;s the only one who can hear her Acura thump; and Dale&apos;s spark plug wires keep trying to escape. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray demonstrate their unmatched ability to plant all four feet firmly in their mouths and endanger their marriages— all while diagnosing a simple vacuum leak. Later, however, they just might make amends by helping to save Beth&apos;s marriage, with a ruling on whether her Civic&apos;s clutch should be more afraid of Beth or her husband. Elsewhere, Susan is a philosophy professor by day, and a pig rescuer by night. Is there one vehicle that can handle both lifestyles, or does she need a dedicated Pigmobile? Also, Jackie&apos;s squealing brakes are wreaking havoc for her pet chihuahuas; and Daniel got a very unpleasant surprise when his mechanic removed his distributor cap—think Vincent Price in "The Fly." All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Nancy&apos;s 16-year-old son wants a Camaro. Will she be adbicating all parental responsibility if she buys him one, and is there a good alternative that&apos;s big, ugly, and cool? Also, Pam wants to ease her husband&apos;s guilt over denting her door; Charles succumbed to Male Answer Syndrome trying to diagnose his wife&apos;s noisy Voyager; and, is Kirk&apos;s steering problem a result of Post-Alignment Euphoria, or Post-Alignment Anxiety?

The Car Talk Leadfoot Personality Test give the answer. Elsewhere, Martin&apos;s brilliant roadside fix for his loose muffler could wind up setting the entire Northeast on fire; Dick&apos;s car is blowing so much smoke he&apos;s on Pennsylvania&apos;s Most Wanted Polluters list; and, Elizabeth is wondering if she should let a sleeping nail lie, in her tire.

Elsewhere, late-night TV might be the cure for Sarah&apos;s dented Taurus; a manure overload have made Art&apos;s truck&apos;s steering &amp;*%^! the bed; and, Stephan is bothered by his truck&apos;s knocking, but even more concerned about his mechanic&apos;s fix for it.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, unearthed letters from summer camp prove that the child really is father to the man, at least when it comes to our Technical Spiritual and Menu Advisor, John "Bugsy" Lawlor. Elsewhere, Lee liberated herself from her mechanic by changing her own oil, but also got liberated from her cash when she poured the oil into her transmission; Cameron needs a lesson in how to burn rubber; and Carly becomes the poster child for Repair Avoidance Syndrome by not getting her shaking Civic looked at. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Eddie and Edie Electron made their way home in Michelle&apos;s Saturn. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Anne&apos;s family is planning a cross-country road trip. Is their Mercury Villager up to the task, or likely to wind up being pushed off the top of Pike&apos;s Peak when the engine fails? Elsewhere, Arelene (sic) wants her recently retired husband to learn how to work on their six cars. He says cars are too complicated, but is he just blowing smoke? Also, Cindy&apos;s family loves the nurse they hired to take care of Cindy&apos;s mom, but she has a nasty habit of backing into garden gnomes (and other objects) whenever she drives; and, we don&apos;t know why Keith&apos;s electric winch gave out when he was hauling a tree stump, but we&apos;re pretty sure Keith deserved it.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, is "Backseat Driver Syndrome" incurable? Lani got used to yelling at her husband when he was a stinko driver, but now that he&apos;s doing better behind the wheel, she&apos;s still nagging from the passenger seat. Old habits die hard, it seems. Meanwhile, Christine is wondering if she needs to give up knitting in the passenger seat, lest a deploying airbag turn her needles into projectiles. Also, Jem needs to clean a stuck valve, but the gunk be the only thing holding his engine together; Matthew&apos;s struggles to start his Jetta are giving his neighbor&apos;s lots of laughs; and even after three alignments, Russ still thinks his car be headed for a ditch. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Howard ran out of brake fluid during a long drive, and is wondering if he could have used his bottle of tequila to fill in; Charlotte&apos;s VW dealer accused her of killing her clutch, but Charlotte&apos;s ex-husband and ex-boyfriend both leaped to her defense; and, Timothy is wondering if it&apos;s time to cut his losses on the Maserati that has him on a first-name basis with AAA. All this, plus the unfortunate tale of Tommy meeting Princess the pooch, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, the Click and Clack Forensics team tries to figure out why Sarah&apos;s Volvo burst into flames on her way home from its 60,000 mile service. Elsewhere, the good news for Allison is that there are still sparks between her and her husband. The bad news is, we mean that literally. Can those sparks turn from shocking to amorous? Also, can Paul transform his Subaru into a convertible for Summer, and avoid a catastrophe? And, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bill cut the cable that was keeping his Tahoe from sinking to the bottom of a lake. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Even the best Puzzle Masters make an occasional mistake. But Martin Gardner and Will Shortz probably never had one of their errors exposed as dramatically (and hilariously) as Ray&apos;s recent mango tree Puzzler. Find out how it plays out, this week on the Best of Car Talk. Elsewhere, Robert&apos;s Mercedes dealer gave him a blanket and pen to apologize for over-filling his engine with oil. Should Robert have asked them to wrap a new engine in that blanket? Also, Carey thinks her husband&apos;s downshifting advice be responsible for her Expedition&apos;s clunk, but the noise have more to do with the 9,000 pounds of barbecue equipment Carey is hauling around; and, a tale of what happens when overly-encumbered by the thought process engineers try to paint an apartment. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Will Tom and Ray send them to a dealership, or a stable? Elsewhere, Christine and her mom&apos;s cars are sending each other smoke signals from under the hood; Burt is hoping his oil leak replacement plan means he never has to do an oil change; and how should Mario take care of his Mercedes in Italy during the 10 months of the year he spends in Alaska? And, shouldn&apos;t his calendar be the other way around? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, how can Doug diplomatically tell his wife she&apos;s a slob when it comes to cars, and should his new car be a stick shift, so she can&apos;t drive it? Ray&apos;s telling of his wife&apos;s turn from neatness to the dark side provides a cautionary tale. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Richard resorted to shock therapy to get his pet goats to stop climbing on his cars, and if Richard&apos;s girlfriend Doris started speaking to him again. And, why did Paul go to a cobbler instead of a body shop when his gas pedal fell through the floor of his Datsun? All this and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Is there any possibility that Paula isn&apos;t completely nuts? Elsewhere, Dick&apos;s truck bounces when he steps on the brakes, but can Dick stay awake long enough for Tom and Ray to explain why? Also, a ski trip turned Jennifer&apos;s Geo into a low rider; Betsy&apos;s Toyota is sliding around Martha&apos;s Vineyard; and Peter&apos;s wife always said, "A car is just a car", until she drove Peter&apos;s new Jaguar.

Elsewhere, Ron tried to find a vacuum leak with propane, and now has two fewer eyebrows to show for it; the VW Westfalia Josie inherited from her dad has been starting and wandering off on its own; and is that 150-pound log Lucia put in her Corolla&apos;s trunk, to stop it from fishtailing on the ice, doing more harm than good?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, why are Helen&apos;s Mercedes&apos; tires growing mold? Tom and Ray say it&apos;s because Helen drives the car infrequently, to which Helen replies, "Au contraire Piston Pusses!" Elsewhere, Linda&apos;s fiance insists on washing his car before a long trip, to improve its gas mileage. Is he right, or just falling prey to the old "clean underwear" theory? Also, Scott&apos;s wife gave him a homework assignment—write a paper explaining why he should keep the &apos;77 MG that&apos;s been sitting untouched in their garage for the last year; and you&apos;ll be shocked, shocked to learn that John&apos;s "cheap and reliable" Ferarri is making a loud, and likely expensive, noise. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, Kim&apos;s husband couldn&apos;t resist buying a Lexus that had been sitting in an airport parking lot for four years. Kim thinks the car was used for nefarious deeds, and is plagued by bad vibes. But Kim&apos;s own purchase make her husband&apos;s look sane by comparison. Meanwhile, another martial dispute is brewing in Alaska, where Samantha and her husband can&apos;t agree on the best place to hang dry cleaning. Can Tom and Ray referee his one, without knowing exactly what dry cleaning is, anyway? Also, Stephan&apos;s solution to his Golf&apos;s rough running was either brilliant or wacko; Jessica&apos;s power steering pump made a 90-degree turn; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if John&apos;s wife made it from Buffalo to San Diego in her Cabriolet.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jill&apos;s pal keeps telling her she needs to do more highway driving to "blow the stuff" out of her car. Jill&apos;s not opposed to this, but what exactly is she trying to blow out? Elsewhere, Eleanor is leaving on a six-month, around-the-world bicycle tour and she wants to know what to do with her truck while she&apos;s gone. Tom and Ray want to know how Eleanor plans to pedal across a few oceans. Also, after Lauren&apos;s boyfriend drove down Mount Washington with the emergency brake on, Lauren is wondering if she needs new brakes, and/or a new boyfriend. And, Rich&apos;s broken gas gauge gives Tom and Ray a chance to fail Calculus, again! All that and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Bill&apos;s truck rolled into a lake. There&apos;s one cable keeping it from sinking to the bottom. Should Bill call Jacques Cousteau for a rescue, or cut the cable? Elsewhere, Victoria is looking for a quartet of $2,000 cars for her sons; Jenny&apos;s newlywed husband lost 15 pounds, and his now-oversized wedding ring is missing in their Jeep&apos;s dashboard; and, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if David&apos;s car-induced cough is cured, and if his brain cells are still intact. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, could cow stomach magnets have improved the gas mileage on Tim&apos;s Jaguar? Or is that udderly (sorry) ridiculous? And, down in Antarctica, Summer is coming, but Matt&apos;s vehicle is still having trouble when the thermometer dips below a balmy minus 40 degrees. Elsewhere, Tom and Ray are in the holiday spirit, with some creative gift suggestions for men, comforting advice for Adrian who wants to put a wreath on her car but is worried it&apos;ll spontaneously combust, and they&apos;ve got news of a major holiday merger. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Heidi&apos;s Lincoln is under assault from a local bird that&apos;s itching for a fight, with its own reflection! Can Heidi save her car without ending up on the Audubon Society&apos;s Most Wanted list? Elsewhere, Shawn needs help with two annoying noises. One is coming from his Caravan, and the other is his wife laughing at him. Also, Janet and her small-town neighbors can&apos;t decide whether they should keep their cars running during their roadside chats; Steve&apos;s truck is bouncing its way down the highway; and glass artist Dara have to make a couple of Click and Clack dashboard figurines if she wants help quieting her Subaru.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, here&apos;s a first. Ephraim went to the dealer to complain that his Audi&apos;s gas mileage was too good. Apparently, said gas mileage nearly doubled when Ephraim&apos;s fiancee began driving the Audi, so there must be something wrong with the car, right? As Tom and Ray would say, "Au contraire, piston puss!" Elsewhere, Rachel&apos;s mechanic warned her of "boulder intrusion" if she doesn&apos;t replace a broken CV boot; Pam&apos;s Toyota is dripping molten lead from the dashboard; and Al and his brother are arguing over whether it&apos;s possible to park a truck in a position from which it&apos;s impossible to move. Also, how one listener is using Car Talk to help teach English. Yes, really. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, why did Bob&apos;s mild-mannered dog go wacko when Bob dumped his Mercedes and bought an Audi? Is the pooch status-obsessed, or is there an olfactory explanation? Elsewhere, Ellen&apos;s Camry smells like rotten eggs, and she thinks her dealer is blowing sulphur up her skirt, rather than fixing it. Also, Glen&apos;s vacation got a little more exciting when his rental car caught on fire. Was it Glen&apos;s fault, and, more important, did he tell the rental company? And on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bill learned to drive a stick shift in time for the high school dance, and if his date is still speaking to him. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Tom and Ray have dispensed lots of booooogus advice over the years, but this week on Car Talk they&apos;ve got one answer that&apos;s so whacked out, it wins one caller&apos;s award for the most brilliant piece of bamboozling he&apos;s ever heard. The guys be on more solid ground convincing Benjamin that doing donuts in Dad&apos;s Camry indeed have cooked the power steering pump. Also, should Kathy be concerned that her husband carries a picture of his long-lost Studebaker in his wallet— but not one of her? And, everything you need to know about friendship, explained in two minutes. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Nathan is living in a redwood tree to protest deforestation. He&apos;s noticed that one of the trucks that passes his perch every day is running rough, so he&apos;s decided to take "shade tree mechanic" to a whole new level, and try to help his nemesis smooth out his ride. Elsewhere, after 30 years of clean driving, Esther has racked up three speeding tickets in the last six months. She&apos;s convinced it&apos;s the car&apos;s fault. Can she convince Tom and Ray to write her a Get Out of Jail Free letter? Also, Chris insists on turning off his Subaru&apos;s AC at Stop signs. He thinks he&apos;s saving the engine. Chris&apos; wife thinks he&apos;s a wimp. What do Tom and Ray think? Find out, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Margo&apos;s dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; Drew can&apos;t decide if his shuddering engine really is a problem, or if he&apos;s a moron; and, "Martha" bought a used van from a dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it.

Elsewhere, Sharon&apos;s friends at the retirement community are getting a little over-stimulated by her Taurus&apos; lurid groan; Cathy and David are arguing over whether it&apos;s better to drive down Mount Washington with a screaming transmission or burning brakes; Max has a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a free Mustang—that&apos;s been sitting underwater for the last 7 years; and can Sarah&apos;s Saturn haul her belongings from Illinois to Arizona without dying in Nebraska?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, can Bill learn how to drive stick in time to drive his date to the homecoming dance? Given that his other driving options are a minivan and a station wagon, we certainly hope so. Elsewhere, Heather wants to drive her Subaru from Seattle to Maine to visit her parents, but the car not make it past Minnesota. Can Tom and Ray help facilitate this family reunion? And, did Abby damage her transmission by backing down a steep driveway in Drive, or is she suffering from Tom&apos;s diagnosis of "Female Guilt Syndrome"? And, do you have what it takes to be crowned Philosopher King? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Click and Clack dive headlong into relationship advice. The result? Further proof of their legendary status as relationship morons! Also, Nechama&apos;s hood is rusted shut. Can she play dumb, go for an oil change and hope the guys at the corner station fix it for free? Marge and her dad are at odds over the safety of talking on a cell phone while refueling. Can Tom and Ray calm the familial waters? Plus, Andrew is a 15-year old political hopeful looking for a car to impress the voters, and Paul needs a new cocktail for his car, which already has a smoking problem. All that, plus how do Tom and Ray prepare for the show? Find out this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ivan went for an oil change, and was told he needed a special detergent beause his oil was clumpy. Did his oil change guy base this on a close examination of Ivan&apos;s engine, or a quick guess on Ivan&apos;s gullibility? Also, can $170 be too much to spend on a dream car? In the case of the truck Michelle&apos;s husband just bought her, it might be. Can Tom, Ray, and a few thousand rolls of duct tape re-kindle Michelle&apos;s passion? Find out, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Click and Clack delve into the subject of dashboard icons and the best geographical position for a duct taped, plastic Jesus. After all, the roads are dangerous and drivers need all the protection they can get! Also, Sarah&apos;s minivan was stolen twice in one day (this is one case where the third time is not the charm!); John&apos;s tires are gonzo. Was it due to a defect or his laziness? And Liz&apos;s Honda has a horrible B.O. smell. Can she blame it on her husband? All that, plus the answer to this season&apos;s inaugural puzzler, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Lee&apos;s mild-mannered wife&apos;s temper and vocabulary both take a dive, but only when she listens to our show. Are Tom and Ray carriers of a new form of ABS—Aberrant Behavior Syndrome? Meanwhile, tempers are also flaring out in California, where Jim&apos;s truck is polluting his entire town; and down in Hendersonville, Kentucky, where Brian&apos;s merging strategy is incredibly efficient, and also incredibly rude. Also, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Sarah&apos;s kids really held a peeing contest in her car while she was away; and, can Bill in Alaska get his forklift running in time to get us our halibut? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>"Monsieur, your car! It ees burnt to a creesp!" This week on The Best of Car Talk, one of our all-time favorite Magliozzi pranks. The cast includes Ray, a concierge named Henri, and a Ford LTD that has been, shall we say, carboniser. Elsewhere, Unitarian minister Carol finds herself tempted by the earthly pleasures of a Jetta; eternal grad student Erica hopes her Toyota&apos;s noise is serious enough to convince Dad to buy her a new car; Jodi&apos;s Cavalier be too far down the path to Heapdom, New Jersey, to save; and if you keep taking a car apart and putting it back together, will you eventually wind up with two?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray learn first-hand that women do indeed play practical jokes, courtesy of the 21st Century version of the whoopee cushion. The guys are also chastised for not recognizing the value of Art History majors, and neglecting the most important feature in a babe-magnet car. In matters automotive, Matt needs to find a car that can handle his 100,000-mile annual commute, and that will be kind to his tuchus; Marc is wondering if late-night TV could improve his Envoy&apos;s gas mileage; and what does Sirah&apos;s leaking clutch have in common with Ray&apos;s bleeding gums?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dana&apos;s wife&apos;s brakes squeak only when he drives her car. Could it be holding a grudge, or is Dana driving too much like a geek? Elsewhere, Sylvia thinks her VW&apos;s problems be a result of spending two years near a uranium mine; Jim is almost finished restoring a Land Cruiser, but is still searching for the perfect sound; and, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Ralph&apos;s Suburban really was playing "Beat the Clock."

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tommy&apos;s 16-year old son Alex explains why it&apos;s in the entire family&apos;s best interests for him to own his own car. We need your help deciding whether Alex is full of wisdom, or something we can&apos;t say on a family show. Elsewhere, Nancy and her boyfriend are about to buy their first car together. He wants a vintage MG, but she&apos;s the one who&apos;ll have to keep it running, unless they find one with a sidecar for a mechanic. Also, Marc learns two valuable lessons. First, never buy an old Peugeot. Second, never pay your mechanic before he finishes the job; and is Heather&apos;s plan to play a practical joke on her brother&apos;s car too realistic? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, are Tom and Ray&apos;s seemingly moronic questions actually a form of deep philosophical inquiry, worthy of Kierkegaard or Camus? Probably not, but one listener&apos;s theory is at least worth a few laughs! Elsewhere, Debra is taking push-starting to a new level—she has to do it just to get her key to turn. Also, should Anne accept a free Range Rover or Mazda for her 16-year old son to drive? Fortunately, we have a 16 year-old Magliozzi on hand to counter Tom and Ray&apos;s advice to just let the kid walk. And, on Stump the Chumps, did Heidi manage to keep her husband from changing the timing belt on her Volvo himself? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>It is an affliction that has touched millions of lives, perhaps none more so than Tom and Ray— the need for guys to speak in great detail on things about which they know absolutely.... nothing. Nada. Squat. This week on The Best of Car Talk, we probe the signs, the symptoms and the causes of Male Answer Syndrome. Our case studies? Tom and Ray&apos;s attempts to figure out why Kristin&apos;s Sentra is stalling on turns after a near-fender bender; and whether Bruce&apos;s son can paint his Town Car and have the job last longer than three weeks. Thankfully, an MAS respite is in store, as we learn that Gina&apos;s husband is taking the fun out of his mid-life crisis convertible by being a little too careful—he&apos;s cleaning bugs off the windshield, while he&apos;s driving. Is Gina being too much of a nag trying to get him to stop, or are those dope slaps she&apos;s administering well earned? All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mike&apos;s Lincoln turns into a low-rider every time his 350-pound nephew rides in the back seat. Will it be cheaper for Mike to fix his suspension, or get his nephew to join Weight Watchers? Elsewhere, Marsha is worried her husband is too sane to drive her BMW without killing the clutch; Ralph&apos;s Suburban seems to be channeling the vintage TV game show "Beat the Clock"; and Lee&apos;s air conditioner started a thunderstorm in his Civic. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Meet Arlene&apos;s daughter: destroyed the cooling fan and made things worse by pouring cold Mountain Dew into the overheating radiator. Can Arlene fix the Volvo and her daughter? Elsewhere, Glenn&apos;s unorthodox shifting is earning him glares and dope slaps from his wife; Kate&apos;s mechanic husband can&apos;t figure out her car&apos;s starting problem, despite the fact that he&apos;s shopping for a bigger boat; and Freudian therapy techniques save Tom and Ray, as they try to solve Chet&apos;s steering and transmission problems.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, how do you attract a guy who&apos;s whizzing by at 60 miles per hour? Stella is renting a highway billboard for a personal ad and, to make a questionable idea even worse, is turning to Tom and Ray for design help. Elsewhere, after having his brake pedal sink to the floor twice in stop-and-go traffic, Chris thinks it&apos;s time to either figure out what&apos;s wrong, or update his life insurance; deli salesman Frank have to part with a couple of spiral cut hams to find out why his car is making noise; and, why does Mabel&apos;s Subaru sound like she&apos;s torturing a chihuahua when starts it? All this, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ben is scared to death to ride with his mom. She used to drive race cars, and still likes to treat Main Street as if it was Le Mans. Can Tom and Ray help Ben slow Mom down, or does he need to start hiding her keys? Elsewhere, Aaron thinks his Toyota is haunted by the spirit of Maurice Chevalier; Jamie wants to achieve his life&apos;s ambition of owning a vehicle with power steering; and, Kristina&apos;s truck is backfiring so loudly, everyone in 500-foot radius ducks and covers. Also, how could three drops of soda burn an Accord&apos;s leather seat? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Will Tom and Ray find them innocent or guilty, and what was Sarah thinking by leaving them alone in the first place? Elsewhere, can three totaled Subarus combine to make one drivable one for Karen?

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Janet&apos;s beloved Grand Marquis got flooded in Houston&apos;s torrential rains. Janet decided to keep the car, despite her insurance wanting to total it. How big a mistake did she make? Well, probably not as big as the one Michael is about to make. He bought a new VW Jetta with a stick shift, but his wife really wanted an automatic, so Michael is considering a transmission transplant. Elsewhere, Flap&apos;s husband can&apos;t follow directions 30 seconds after she tells him which way to go; Megan can&apos;t decide if her mechanic is a moron or a sleazeball; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bob set off a bug bomb in his truck, assuming he has enough brain cells left to form a sentence. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ann has the hots for her mechanic, and needs Tom and Ray&apos;s help on two fronts. First, she needs to break something so she has an excuse to bring in her car. Second, she needs to let Bubba (as we&apos;ll call him) know she&apos;s not as young as he thinks she is. Elsewhere, Jayne&apos;s car is losing oil and lots of it, but she has no idea where it&apos;s going; Wendy is wondering if her hood flying open is a sign it&apos;s time to dump her Mazda; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Bob got his truck&apos;s heat working in time for a North Carolina summer.

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, a certain motor mouth puts his mouth in gear, as Tom tells the world his wife looks like a truck. And guess who&apos;s listening? Along with this classic moment,  Tom and Ray try to figure out why Marc&apos;s gas mileage dropped by 20 percent after a tune-up; whether Bob can set off a bug bomb in his car without killing himself along with the flies; and if Kara&apos;s Subaru can survive after she filled the gas tank with water. Also, is Ronnie going to suffer a fried tuchus if she buys a black car in the Sunshine State? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Some issues are so grave they require even the most politically averse to stand up. This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray stand up in support of... the siesta. That&apos;s right. The mid-day nap needs saving, and is there anyone better to do it, than Tom and Ray? In matters automotive, Scott needs help getting his truck to start, and protecting it from his friend Fat Tony, with his big bucket o&apos; tools; Mike appears to have found the rarest of creatures, an honest transmission repairman;, and Peggy swears she heard Tom and Ray recommend using kerosene to wash her new car and preserve its paint job. Also, can Gillian get a French-to-English translation for a truck part without disclosing she&apos;s a CIA agent? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, can Bill keep his beloved Town Car after it hits 250,000 miies? Sure, if he follows a few simple rules such as never driving over 10 miles per hour, or more than a 10-minute walk from his house. Elsewhere, Heidi needs a new car to fit her two kids in carseats, and their Grandma. Can she somehow cram them all into her dream car, a Miata? Also, this week&apos;s Auto Noise Emporium features a whining Civic, a scraping Camry, and a Taurus with a vibraslap stuck in the air conditioner. All this and more this week on The Best of Car Talk</description>

<description>This week, on The Best of Car Talk, fuses keep blowing in Allison&apos;s car. Can it be fixed or would investing in her local auto parts store be a better choice? Meanwhile, Nat&apos;s Saab keeps running away from him. He needs help putting on the brakes before he looks like a fool, again, in front of his future in-laws. And Erin&apos;s roommate has too many cars... and not enough driveway. Can she convince her roomie to sell one set of wheels, or is it time for Click and Clack to help arrange an "unfortunate accident"? All that, and a non-bogus puzzler, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, John dove head first into his mid-life crisis by buying a Miata. Then, he started obsessing over how best to preserve its soft top. Can Tom and Ray rescue John from his mid-life crisis crisis? Elsewhere, Alicia&apos;s Camry began coughing up furballs, and if that sounds nasty, just wait until Ray tells her what it&apos;s likely to cough up next. Also, Peggy wants to meet a guy by pretending to sell a car she doesn&apos;t own; Lewis&apos; car is running great, but won&apos;t move; and can Joe save $400 by replacing his own radiator? Sure-- if he doesn&apos;t mind spending $500, plus the cost of the new radiator. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, should Heidi let her husband change her Volvo&apos;s timing belt? Before you answer, we should tell you that Heidi&apos;s husband is a tennis pro, with no repair experience, and that messing up this job will kill the engine. Wanna rethink your answer? Elsewhere, Craig&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s mother bought him a new truck. If Craig breaks up with the daughter, is it also splitsville with the truck? Also, Nathan dinged his girlfriend&apos;s Civic while driving it without a license—or her permission. Can Tom and Ray help him fix the car&apos;s thunk before the next sound is her giving Nathan a dope slap? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom&apos;s vegan daughter is about to head off to drive cross-country in her truck, and spend a year working on an organic farm. Should Tom have pre-emptive work done to make sure she doesn&apos;t get stuck in Carnivore Land? Elsewhere, Doug&apos;s noisy brakes have him wondering if his mechanics are too nice to be competent; Warren wants to give his Olds a fresh paint job, but his wife is convinced that will only speed its demise; and Mike is wondering why we hang fuzzy dice from rear-view mirrors, rather than, say, fuzzy socket wrenches. All this and lots more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, the auto-confessional is open, as a former road crew worker explains how he made sure he&apos;d always have a supply of potholes to repair every Spring; and Seminarian Matt seeks absolution for letting his Trooper leak oil all over his environmentalist landlord&apos;s driveway. Elsewhere, Tom and Ray try a new strategy for difficult calls. Will "do whatever you want" work any better than "we have no idea what&apos;s going on?" Also, Marlene&apos;s Montreal-Boston drive has become non-stop, because if she takes a break her car won&apos;t re-start; and could Debbie&apos;s black smoke have anything to do with the rag that was wrapped around her air filter? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Richie tried to save money on oil changes by installing a dual-filtration system on his truck. The resulting acrid smoke seems to prove Tom and Ray&apos;s mantra that, "It&apos;s the stingy man who pays the most." Elsewhere, Mare&apos;s husband accidentally inflated their tires to 90 PSI. Should Mare get rid of the tires, or her husband? Also, Scott&apos;s beloved "Uncle Know-it-All" gave him some questionable transmission advice, so he&apos;s turning to two Know-Nothings; John&apos;s trying to slow down his lead-foot son by putting blocks of wood under the gas pedal; and did you know that William Shakespeare was Italian? Neither did we, but Tom and Ray seem to think he was. There&apos;s much ado about a whole lot of nothing, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Joanna&apos;s 16-year-old son is ready for his first car, and what could be better than a vintage ice cream truck, complete with a working freezer and music?! Should Joanna buy the truck, and thank her lucky stars her son didn&apos;t ask for a Viper? Or is this aging freezer on wheels one push pop away from a disaster. Elsewhere, Sarah discovered that she can&apos;t get her dome light switch to work unless she pours water on it; Bear&apos;s 100,000-mile plugs have become 200,000-mile plugs after fusing themselves to the engine block; and Juliette&apos;s timing belt be hanging on by a thread. Also, on Stump the Chumps we find out if John cleaned up his act and his disgustingly messy car for a date. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, John&apos;s car is a pigsty. As he prepares for a first date with a "classy woman," should he tidy it up or let her see him for the slob he truly is? Elsewhere, Barry had a numskull moment and drove his Blazer into a ditch. Now he can&apos;t understand why the engine is running better post-submersion!  Also, Chooch&apos;s beloved Accord has become melodramatic; a black-light oil leak check is either too expensive or too psychedelic for Dorothea&apos;s husband; and, Tom and Ray discover a new strategy for handling difficult callers—diagnosis by intimidation. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Mike and his uncle are planning to get their kicks on Route 66, driving the legendary highway from California to Chicago this summer. But the ultimate road trip demands the ultimate road trip car, right? So, anyone out there have a &apos;54 Corvette you&apos;re willing to lend out to a couple of strangers? Elsewhere, Penny is wondering whether it was a good idea to buy a used Volvo from her ex-husband&apos;s new wife; and, Tom and Ray have to resort to desperate measures to help Kevin turn off his oxygen sensor light. Speaking of desperate measures, Ellen pays a return visit to Stump the Chumps to let us know how far she had to go to get her husband to stop buying performance add-ons for his Blazer. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dr. Anastas is having a slow day at NASA. How do we know? He&apos;s wondering how his car would fare in zero gravity, if he brought it along for a ride on NASA&apos;s "Vomit Comet" airplane. There might be some traction problems, but would the car even start?  Elsewhere, Ann&apos;s snowboarding trip got more exciting when her tire caught fire heading down the mountain; Dana fears she&apos;s heading for an explosion after her husband epoxied her Civic&apos;s leaking radiator with J-B Weld; and, every time Dennis washes his wife&apos;s car, it won&apos;t start the next day. Also, the Great Winter Debate: if you shovel out a parking space, is it yours for keeps? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, are Mari and her husband  grown-up enough to graduate from a Neon to a Mercedes, even if it means having to brush their teeth and hair every day? Elsewhere, Abbie got into a fender bender with a Physics Professor, and hopes he can help her cover the rental car. Would she have better luck with someone from the Philosophy department? Also, Ben almost managed to set his car and vacuum cleaner both on fire on the same day; Kathie&apos;s boyfriend need to be dumped for suggesting it&apos;s okay to tailgate; and, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Dan&apos;s truck suffered from a "classic case" of Car Talk Bogus Answer Syndrome. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, in true Magliozzi fashion, a brotherly pat on the back turns into an insult. Hopefully, Ray can recover in time to explain why Michelle&apos;s car radio changes the station whenever someone steps on the brake. Elsewhere, Cindy inherited Dad&apos;s car. The good news it has only 39,000 miles on it. The bad news is it also has the smell from 39,000 cigars Dad smoked while driving it. Also, can Brenda&apos;s relationship and her boyfriend&apos;s clutch both survive her learning to drive a stick shift in his BMW; and, can Ken avoid divorce number four by pre-screening partners based on their cars? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, how do Tom and Ray celebrate Valentine&apos;s day? With gifts likely to earn them each a few nights sleeping in the garage! But, in classic, "those who can&apos;t do" fashion, they&apos;re happy to give college student Zoey tips for meeting the cute guy working in her dorm. In matters more technical, (yet still wacko!), Ed needs help choosing an engine for the Miata-sized airplane he&apos;s building in his garage; and, Mary just bought a vintage Ford Galaxy sight unseen,  and now she&apos;s scouting the area rest homes for a mechanic to work on it. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if "Fred" ever confessed to his wife that he hates the Saab she bought him as a surprise gift. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week The Best of Car Talk kicks off with a tale that could only happen in Alaska. It starts with Mom spotting a moose near the driveway, and ends with the family&apos;s Suburban driving through their basement— and taking the oil furnace with it. Then, in preparation for Valentine&apos;s Day, we have two auto-marital disputes. Kit&apos;s husband is trying to convince her that her car&apos;s noise isn&apos;t the brakes, just its mudflaps; and Angelina&apos;s husband wants to put bigger tires on their Civic to improve its gas mileage. Also, why does Marcia&apos;s Maxima smell like flatulence, even when her husband isn&apos;t in the car? All this, plus a Puzzler from the Ceiling Light series, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Ray decides to play Stormchaser, during one of the worst blizzards in Our Fair State&apos;s history. Fortunately, we have an eyewitness account of his bold, daring, and completely idiotic adventure—even his dog was scared! Elsewhere in the post-blizzard landscape, Susan is wondering if she can just leave her car buried in snow until the 4th thaw; and Kristopher need Lord Kelvin himself to convince his girlfriend to use her Golf&apos;s heater. Also, can Beth do anything do protect her white Camry from the local berry-eating mockingbird that&apos;s using it as a commode? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Danni bought a used Range Rover in the midst of what she calls pregnancy-induced insanity. Reality quickly set in, as her skyscraper-esque husband couldn&apos;t fit in the car, and it racked up a few thousand dollars in repair bills in no time. Should she cut her losses and dump this impulse buy? Elsewhere, Charlie had to replace his fuel pump three times in the last year, and is tired of having them fall on his chest; Kristy need a stethoscope and a potato to figure out why her car is making noise; and physicist Robert is too busy trying to solve thermonuclear fusion to get his timing belt changed. All this, plus the tale of Sonja Henie&apos;s Zamboni, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Bob swears that smashing his Volvo into a rock improved its performance; Rick&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s VW spent the weekend in the shop and came back with an additional 20,000 miles on the odometer; and Lisa&apos;s Estonian Moskvitch dies, and will only re-start if she jams a piece of wood into the ignition. Also, Tom and Ray try to referee a family dispute over a boardgame and maange to turn Brain Quest into Dummy Quest. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>Ever wonder why Tom and Ray exclaim, "Sonja Henie&apos;s tutu!", seem to need haircuts with an unusual urgency, or got the idea that somebody moved the Alamo? This week on The Best of Car Talk, we share the tales behind the phrases that usually make the guys blow milk out their noses just by their mere mention. In matters auttomotive, Judy&apos;s husband is telling her to ignore her ever-rising temperature gauge despite already cooking one engine; Will wants to put the entire windhsield wiper fluid industry out of business; and Paula&apos;s friend killed her battery by leaving the lights on, and then blamed her car. All this and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on the Best of Car Talk, "60 Minutes" correspondent Morley Safer turns the hot lights on Tom and Ray. Allegations of financial malfeasance? A class-action suit over bogus Puzzlers? No, Morley&apos;s just annoyed that he can&apos;t find parts for his beloved Peugeot, aka, the "Crouching Tiger" in his garage, and he blames Tom and Ray&apos;s relentless Peugeot bashing. Elsewhere, Jane is convinced her van&apos;s gas tank is shrinking; Peter killed his Accord&apos;s battery but can&apos;t understand why the alarm is still sounding; and, can Adrienne convince her daredevil husband that driving down mountain passes with the cruise control on is not good for her car, or their odds to live to see another ski weekend? All this, and lots more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, it&apos;s one of our all-time classic calls, and the shaggiest of shaggy dog stories—Max the mechanic&apos;s heroic attempt to replace his customer&apos;s beloved pet dog. Elsewhere, Major Tom&apos;s Jeep is acclimating to its new home in Colorado by doing 360&apos;s on ice; Toast&apos;s battery drains in the rain, even if the car isn&apos;t running; and Louann&apos;s Civic is fouling plugs, and her mood. Also, can Natalie welcome Dad home from vacation by saying anything other than, "I dented your car?" All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tom and Ray are honored with the first (and probably last) award for Excellence in Worthlessness. They immediately prove themselves worthy, by dodging Dodie&apos;s question about overdrive on her Nissan, and instead focusing on the two sons who didn&apos;t help buy her the car. And, Rebecca&apos;s BMW&apos;s noise is less intriguing than why she broke up with the boyfriend who gave it to her. Also, how steamer trunks helped derail Steve&apos;s plan to restore a vintage Buick; And, why holiday overeating not be such a bad idea. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, have Tom and Ray found a more productive way to settle their disagreements than, "You moron"? Find out as they differ over whether John should dump his family&apos;s beloved Chevy before its hyper-sensitive brakes send the family dental bills into 7 figures. Elsehwere, Phil&apos;s wife thinks she&apos;d be less paranoid about her car breaking down if she was married to a mechanic; Dennis is looking for a non-combative gesture to let other drivers know he&apos;s sorry for cutting them off; and after a year of listening to her Volvo moan Alice has decided it&apos;s finally time to figure out what&apos;s ailing it. All this, plus some gift ideas straight from the floors of Car Talk Plaza, and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dee is freezing her butt off now that winter is here. Can Click and Clack help her toast her tush in her Dodge Durango? Sybil has a vexing noise, and becomes a garage apprentice as she heads out to the driveway to make the diagnosis. Meanwhile, Craig wants to know, what&apos;s the deal with gas tanks and why can&apos;t they all be on the same side? Jessica is hoping her Audi can be fixed so she doesn&apos;t have to make it through winter on her boyfriend&apos;s scooter. And David. Poor David. His Honda Accord is sending him to financial ruin. If he coughed up another eight cents a day, could he really be in a new car? All that, plus some earth shattering research on parking spaces, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, did Tom and Ray help Dana and her friend remove a chunk of the Berlin Wall from his Dad&apos;s BMW? Dana&apos;s back for a round of Stump the Chumps. Spoiler alert: the word "Dummkopfs" is used. Elsewhere, David thinks his Volvo is giving him Legionnaire&apos;s Disease; Glenn has mice living in his Miata, and fears he&apos;ll have to bring them along on his road trip from New Orleans to Oregon. And, Leanne is hearing a horrible grinding noise when she uses her new key in her husband&apos;s Pathfinder. Is it coming from the car or her husband&apos;s teeth? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, can Jim use an old car transmission as a potter&apos;s wheel? Reverse could come in handy next time he mis-throws a pot. Elsewhere, Cindy&apos;s friends say her Mercedes is scaring off prospective dates with guys whose cars aren&apos;t as nice as hers; grad student Christine&apos;s parents offered her a free Buick station wagon, but Christine can&apos;t decide if the embarrassment of driving it is too costly; and we meet Tom and Ray&apos;s new BFF—Sal, the quintessential New Yorker. Sal is a retired mailman, but he still have to get up at the crack of dawn this winter if he wants his car to move. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on The Best of Car Talk, Alan thinks his Mercedes came with a 100,000-mile, self-destruct program. It’s suffered a series of problems since the odometer rolled over and, with the Check Engine light now linked to his MasterCard account, Alan thinks it be time to move on. Elsewhere, Fred lied to his wife about loving his friend’s new car, and was punished by receiving the same car as a birthday present. Should he ‘fess up and risk the consequences, or suffer for the next 150,000 miles? Also, do Tom and Ray have enough liability insurance to help Keri soup up her Hornet scooter so she can win a rematch against a Vespa? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, we pay tribute to our beloved brother, friend, and co-host Tom Magliozzi, who passed away Monday, 3rd. You’ll hear many of our favorite moments featuring Tom the consummate radio professional, Tom the philosopher king, Tom the storyteller, and ultimately Tom, the guy who enjoyed nothing more than to sit with his brother and all you listeners for an hour a week, laughing his butt off. This special edition of the show will be hosted by Ray. We’ll be listening, and we hope you will, too.</description>

Elsewhere, J.D. just lost his girlfriend, and be about to lose his beloved van, too. Can Tom and Ray help him save either one? Also, budding acupuncturist Jody wants to quiet her car by finding its chi; Jane wants to buy a stretch limo to drive around town in, but everyone thinks she’s nuts— except her grandkids, and Tommy; and how did Scott’s Ford Focus move across a Home Depot parking lot while he was shopping?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Jill has noticed a raft of men picking their noses in their cars. Is this topic too juvenile and tasteless even for Tom and Ray? Are you kidding? Tune in as they dive deep to try to explain why a man’s car is his nostril&apos;s sanctuary. In matters a bit more serious, Paul’s car is smoking like a chimney,and he’s hoping to find the right additive cocktail that will get it through to spring; Bernie and Rollie’s test drive at a dealer ended with an encounter with a light pole, and now the dealer is trying to get them to pay for the damage; and is Jenny or her budding bryologist fiance right about her Civic’s starting problem?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Melissa’s driver’s door wouldn’t stay shut. So she ran to the nearest body shop, right? Um, no—she tied the door to the seat, and has been climbing in through the passenger seat for the last several weeks. Is it time for a Car Talk Cheapskate Intervention? Elsewhere, Colleen’s Dad told her she couldn’t drive his car because he had to break in its new brakes. Was this really a mechanic’s order, or could it be Dad’s way of telling Colleen he thinks she’s a lousy driver? Also, will a flush remove the debris that might be the only thing keeping Reed’s transmission from falling apart? And, if Katie thinks she has gas that’s too old for her cheap camp stove, why on earth is she considering dumping it into her $20,000 car? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Cheryl’s brother has a brilliant solution to his rotting gas tank that could set the entire state of New Jersey on fire—but does that make his idea any less brilliant? Elsewhere, Mike wants to drive his truck into the ground. Oh wait, the truck&apos;s "belt habit" might have already beat him to it. Tamara is considering dumping her beloved Vanagon for a car with modern conveniences, like a horn; and, can Jim make it through a New England winter in a Civic with no heat, and no dashboard?&nbsp; All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Melissa Peterson (a.k.a., “That Little Twerp”) returns with another helpful Car Talk critique. How can Tom and Ray manage to be hippies and geeks at the same time? Elsewhere, Quentin needs to decide whether to take his grandfather’s Dodge Dart Swinger, or keep his blood pressure regulated by just taking Grandpa’s hat from the front seat. Also, Beth’s trailblazing adventure left her Jetta missing a few parts she hopes are non-essential; newly unemployed Bernadette is considering a move from one non-profit to another by entering the world of auto-repair, and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Geoff’s noise really was the sound of one pad slapping. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Ginny and her husband disagree over the optimal speed to drive on a road populated with frogs without croaking them (sorry). Also, a year of a flashing brake lights and noisy brakes has convinced Jim his van have a brake problem; Camille have to purge her key ring to save her Golf; and will this week’s Puzzler Answer give Tom and Ray yet another F in Physics?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tom and Ray delve into the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship. Since they fit into neither category, fortunately their own Mom and sister both weigh in. All of this is prompted by Nancy’s ill-advised decision to tell her adult daughter she waited too long to rotate her tires. Elsewhere, Herbert loves his VW, except for its annoying habit of bursting into flames; Ronnie Sue’s underwear came to the rescue when she burst a heater hose; and can all of Tom and Ray’s behavior be symptoms of an obscure German medical condition called “Witzelsucht”? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Darlene&apos;s bumpy road-trip prompts Ray to remember his explosive lesson about the dangers of over-inflated tires. Elsewhere, Cynthia hopes Tom and Ray can settle her brothers&apos; tug-of-war over a vintage Camaro, but it&apos;s more likely they&apos;ll just add a Magliozzi family feud to the mix. Also, Bill&apos;s steering wheel is re-enacting "Ghostbusters" by oozing an odd substance; Marsha&apos;s wondering if adding oil to her coolant is the end of the world, or at least the end of her Previa; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if marriage cured Ellen&apos;s fiance of his high-performance add-on addiction.

<description>This week on Car Talk, former Red Sox pitcher Bill “Spaceman” Lee plays a round of Stump the Chumps. Find out if Tom and Ray helped get Bill’s BMW running, or thrown one way over the backstop. Elsewhere, Jeff promised his girlfriend he’d get a driver’s license this Summer. The calendar has turned, and Jeff is still sans license, so what he needs now is a good excuse. Also, Ashley loves her Beetle, but it be killing her with CO poisoning; Chris wants to know how big a dope slap to give her husband for keeping the heat on during a six-hour drive in 96 degree temperatures; and can Tom and Ray do any better diagnosing a broken lawnmower than they did on electric brakes?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Richard the Goat Rescuer&apos;s new pals like to climb on things—including cars, and especially Richard&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s Alfa Romeo. Does Richard need to turn to shock therapy to ground the goats and save his relationship? Elsewhere, Jeff&apos;s Isuzu needs a new engine, but Jeff is worried that a transplant will irrevocably change his car&apos;s soul. Can Tom and Ray provide some divine guidance on this existential-automotive conundrum? Also, Helena and her husband found a dream used car with one idiosyncrasy—it only goes in Reverse. Good thing it came with a spare transmission in the trunk. And, guess what turned up in a government auction—Sonja Henie&apos;s tutu! Find out how, this week on Car Talk</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, a Massachusetts man begins speaking with a French accent after an accident. Thus we are introduced to Foreign Accent Syndrome, a neurological oddity which Tommy will be happy to explain, if he can ever stop laughing. Elsewhere, what goes in, must come out—unless ”it” is a piece of the Berlin Wall, stuffed into the trunk of a BMW.&nbsp; A few thousand miles away, John is having the opposite problem—his Bronco’s dipstick refuses to stay in. Also, should Julie fess up about her fender bender in the family van? And, Crystie dropped a nail into her gas tank, and is worried about an explosion. Her mechanic and the Chevy dealer refuse to take her seriously—and she thinks Tom and Ray will? Find out, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Emily dared to correctly diagnose her male friend&apos;s car problem (the horror!) but did her automotive intelligence ruin a potential relationship? Elsewhere, Ted’s solution to his van’s leaky exhaust win a prize for modern sculpture, but will it also kill his engine? Also, Linda needs to use a hair dryer to start her car in weat weather; and from the “be careful what you wish for” department, Jeff wants to get his reluctant 18-year old son to start driving or risk never getting a date. Finally, yet another philosophical theory that explains Tom and Ray: “learned ignorance.” All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Daniel Pinkwater opened his BMW owner’s manual, and discovered it included exercise and diet tips. Is BMW being extra thoughtful or do they just want to make sure Daniel stays alive long enough to finish paying off the car?&nbsp; Elsewhere, Mary Lynn’s husband has been telling her to ignore her car’s scary thumping noise, so she’s hoping to get it fixed while he’s away in China. Also, Reine’s husband have gotten his wallet flushed along with an unnecessary radiator flush; and Bob’s got a ’65 Ambassador convertible for sale, and heard there might be a radio show host in the market for one.

Does Ray need to start searching for a ’65 Ambassador, or is Tommy forever banned from uttering the words, “sleek black beauty”? Elsewhere, Jill’s Civic sounds like Frankenstein, and Aron’s Nissan is imitating Larry from the Three Stooges. Also, how can Craig make his minivan more sexy, other than trading it for a Porsche?

<description>This week on Car Talk, do two people who don’t know what they’re talking about know more or less than one person who doesn’t know what he’s talking about? Andy thinks Tom and Ray’s recent “pas-de-deux of breathaking speculation” on electric brakes have answered this question definitively. Elsewhere, Evan’s son stuffed a golf ball into her car’s exhaust, and she worried it land a hole in one right in the middle of her engine; Christine can’t evict a colony of ants living in her car’s headliner; and Todd’s noisy truck gives Tom a chance to re-live his Army days wih the long-suffering Sgt. McNeeley. Also, one listner’s proposal to re-arrange the days of the week—it’s brilliant, even if it does leave us with five Tuesdays. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.&nbsp;</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, can Tom and Ray help Paul fix the electric brakes on his cattle trailer? Will the fact that they’ve never even heard of electric brakes stand in their way? Of course not! Elsewhere, Kate can’t get her mechanic to take her Acura’s brake problem seriously, and Alice and her husband can’t agree on whether to take the high road or the low road to go visit their daughter. Also,&nbsp; Marian’s truck is having trouble adjusting to life in Cleveland; Army Captain Rob have to go AWOL to get out of a Summer road-trip with his in-laws, and should Erin ease her husband’s descent into Minivan Land by letting him keep his BMW? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dinesh is planning to spend his Summer vacation walking across Death Valley. Yes, really. Dinesh is worried about his support cars surviving the 120 degree daytime temps. Can Tom and Ray stop questioning Dinesh’s sanity long enough to advise? Elsewhere, Deb threw her husband’s BMW into Park while it was still moving. Did she do more damage to the car, or her marriage? Also, Steve wins Fun Dad of the Week— but it came with a full spousal dopeslap&nbsp; for driving across a stream that was deeper than expected; Mary is desperately trying to help her beloved mechanic Herman figure out why her Toyota won’t start; and, is it okay for Art History PhD’s to call themselves “Doctor”? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, do BMW’s really have a unique aroma, and if so, how come Diane’s husband can smell it while she can’t? Is it only discernible to men on the verge of a mid-life crisis? Elsewhere, Ed’s having trouble shifting his car out of Park, and his solution give his insurance company an ulcer; and, Tom and Ray try to stop Steven’s mirrors from twitching before he drives into a ditch. Also, how one student’s GPA plummeted after she listened to a single episode of Car Talk; and in an effort to improve inter-species communication, Tom and Ray translate mechanics’ grunts into English.

Elsewhere, Ron&apos;s check engine light has been on for 75,000 miles, and he&apos;s beginning to think it might be time to figure out what&apos;s causing it; Ellen&apos;s looking for an intervention to help cure her fiancé of his non-stop shopping for performance add-ons for their Blazer; and, can Casey&apos;s career as a bagpipe maker help rid his car of garter snakes?

Then it&apos;s off to help Doctor Gary with an ethical conundrum. If he gives his mechanic car advice, can the mechanic start giving Gary medical tips? Carole wants to know what kind of car she should take to Africa, and has an automotive-fashion question: should she stock up on jog bras for the rough roads ahead?

Can Tom and Ray get Gary off the hook, and, more importantly, get his mother-in-law out of his house? Elsewhere, Barry&apos;s noticing a plethora of dead bugs on his windshield, and thinks driving faster should reduce the casulaty rate. Also, Denise have bitten off more than she can chew by giving into her mid-life-crisis impulse buy of a vintage Volvo; Alan is considering a sitz bath to get his truck to start shifting; and Darlene can&apos;t decide which bubble-headed friend&apos;s advice to follow on filling her gas tank, so she&apos;s turning to two more bubble-heads.

<description>This week on Car Talk, Howard needs to drive a mattress from Boston to “Hunga-Dunga”, and wants to know how to keep it from flying off the roof of his car. Tom and Ray know one method that won’t work, as evidenced by an ill-fated attempt to transport 18 sheets of plywood. Elsewhere, Tina just learned a scary and stinky lesson why you shouldn’t drive drive down a mountain in Neutral; Jerry is looking for an alternative to the “stick and ballet pose” method he’s using to get his convertible top to work; and, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Elisa accepted her parents’ bribe, um we mean, “generous offer” to buy her a new car if she married her live-in boyfriend. And, by popular demand, aonother reading of the Melissa letter. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>We stopped tallying the hate mail we&apos;ve received at Car Talk years ago. But one letter still remains on top of our pile of vituperative missives: this week&apos;s offering from one Melissa Peterson, a.k.a., "That Little Twerp." Maybe it was her need to let us know that her dog hates our show as much as she does. But Tom and Ray will soldier on, despite Melissa&apos;s wrath, and try to convince Gloria that shutting off her car while going 80 miles per hour is not a great way to address its acceleration problems. Elsewhere, Tracy wants to blame her mom for her Civic&apos;s electrical system going wacko; and Tammy is trying without success to convince her husband that Boston drivers aren&apos;t the worst in the world. And, can Evan find a car with a gas pedal that won&apos;t destroy his knee? All this and more, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Sasha learned a new recipe for dealing with a radiator leak--add black pepper and eggs. Did this combo save his engine, or at least provide brunch while he waited for a tow truck? Elsewhere, does Chip need to resort to "tailpipe diplomacy," in the form of a cherry bomb, to get his neighbors to stop warming up their cars for 20 minutes every morning? Also, Bill and his wife are looking for a $700 car that makes them look eccentric rather than cheap; Jennifer&apos;s good deal on a used Volvo not have been so good; and can Tom in California adjust to his new life as a car salesman without succumbing to the white belt and shoes? All this, plus one tourist&apos;s eye-opening visit to Car Talk Plaza, and lots more.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tom and Ray say they&apos;ve never met a noise they didn&apos;t like, but that&apos;s before they encountered the odd thumping sound Janet&apos;s truck is making. And then there&apos;s the sound of their dear Mom Elizabeth, calling to celebrate Mother&apos;s day by complaining about her sons&apos; poor gift selections. Elsewhere, from the Questionable Ideas department, Mark wants to use his Ford Tempo to tow a trailer from Dallas to Pennsylvania; Jonathan is considering using a turkey baster to drain his car&apos;s power steering fluid; and Missy&apos;s 18-year old son wants to buy an Audi Quattro to keep on campus at Boston University. All this, plus the best college application essay ever, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Jere agreed to drive her sister&apos;s co-worker&apos;s husband to work. How did he thank her? By telling everyone (including Jere) she&apos;s a stinko driver. Elsewhere, Dorothy had to rig a wire to her Land Rover&apos;s fan to keep it from shredding the radiator, during her daily drive in Botswana. Will this brilliant solution cook her engine?&nbsp; Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if the "Godfather strategy" helped Joe convince his brother-in-law to remove an old Honda Civic from Joe&apos;s yard; and did a hammer and a "Hey guys, watch this!" really fix Hendie&apos;s brake noise? All this and more, this week no car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Robin is racked with guilt after taking her Corolla to the dealer for its 30,000 mile service, rather than her trusty mechanic. Should she fess up before her mechanic notices there&apos;s someone else&apos;s grease under the hood?&nbsp; Elsewhere, Wendy&apos;s mechanic is so baffled by her Golf&apos;s noise that he&apos;s consulted a Ouija board; Dee tried to get rid of his truck&apos;s noise by driving it into the side of a car; and Amy&apos;s husband is brilliant at everything-- except keeping his car on the right side of the road. Also, should Scott listen to his uncle&apos;s advice and disconnect the odometer on his Accord? (Do we need to mention that Scott&apos;s uncle is a used-car salesman?) All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, the Auto-Psychiatry booth is open, as Dennis tries to figure out why he dreamed about being offered a 1966 Ford Fairlane. Is a Fairlane memory buried in his past, or to paraphrase Dr. Freud, is a heap just a heap? Meanwhile, over in the Auto-Relational Department, Donna treated herself to a spiffy Mazda Miata, but can&apos;t get her husband to relinquish the steering wheel. Also, Tamson&apos;s mechanic be using the "slow milking" approach to diagnosing her Beetle&apos;s noise; Ray has a few final words on Tommy&apos;s Dart; and does Dave need driving lessons or relaxation therapy to prepare for a Summer trip through Ireland with five women? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Mara has tried everything to rid her car of its ant infestation. Well, maybe not everything, since there are no burn marks. Tom and Ray have a way to lure them out that is at once incredibly creative-- and very stupid. Elsewhere, how does Diane reconcile her husband&apos;s desire to rebuild his BMW with her parent&apos;s need to get it off their farm, so the potatoes can be planted? Also, a lesson to car dealers: if you&apos;re going to make up a name for your wife, choose one you know how to spell. And, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom, Ray, and Joan&apos;s husband can correctly diagnose her screeching Ford Festiva. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, one listener&apos;s tribute to Tommy&apos;s dearly departed Dodge Dart will have William Wordsworth rolling over in his grave. "For in the spot where Dart once sat, there&apos;s now but oil stains." Later, Tom and Ray try to rescue a spoon trapped in one car&apos;s vents, and a 20-dollar bill trapped in a driver&apos;s door; and, on a slighlty more urgent note, they try to keep Eric&apos;s engine from disintegrating. Elsewhere, Doug might become the Chuck Yeager of CV joints if he doesn&apos;t mind the risk of getting stuck on a railroad track; and can Environmental Studies major Carl do anything to ease his guilt over driving two ginormous gas guzzlers? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Corinne can&apos;t seem to get an oil change without a broken dipstick as a bonus; Christine&apos;s keys are stuck in her ignition--which not be too worrisome, since her car won&apos;t start; and can struggling musician Dan fix his van&apos;s exhaust with guitar strings and an orange juice can?

Elsewhere, Steve drove over a bowling ball outside a topless bar, which sounds like a great joke set-up, but the punchline could be very expensive. Also, Shanthi is ready to buy a car, but has no place to park it. Does she need to move, or should she forget about the car and keep mooching rides from her friends?

<description>This week on Car Talk, did Howard get the special Three Stooges option on his Lincoln, or is there another reason why it sounds like Curly whenever he gets out of the car. Elsewhere, Tom got conflicting advice on his Taurus&apos; flashing oil light, and he&apos;s wondering who&apos;s the genius, and who&apos;s the quack. So, who better to ask than two genius quacks? Also, John&apos;s Land Cruiser need a new steering box, or his mechanic just be looking for another John-funded trip to Vegas; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Betsy&apos;s truck was really spewing gas because of mud chiggers. All this, plus how one listener&apos;s attempt to solve the Puzzler resulted in a police house call, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, beloved dog meets beloved car, and the results aren&apos;t good, as Will&apos;s dog Moses gets car sick in his truck; specifically, into the defroster vents. Can Will remove the chunks and the smell, or does he need to sell the truck to someone with a really bad sense of smell? Elsewhere, Kris&apos; husband is a dedicated recycler. Unfortunately, he insists on crushing cans by driving over them, and the noise has Kris wondering if she needs to recycle her spouse. Also, what could make an already brutal Maine winter even worse? Eric&apos;s truck horn, which starts honking in zero degree weather, in the middle of the night. And, can Tom and Ray cure novice mechanic Jeremy of his bolt-breaking habit? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dan&apos;s new used Corolla have come with a bonus gift. The previous owner says she threw her engagement ring at her fiance and it fell behind the dashboard. Is the ring still there, or on the new fiancee of the mechanic who previously looked for it? Also this week, Jennifer says her Subaru stinks--literally. She describes its smell as a combination of "old gas" and "dirty mechanic". Will Tom and Ray be too offended to give a diagnosis? And, Turi&apos;s best solution for her smoking Acura be to just throw her keys down the sewer; and Brother Roger got some advice on tires from a mechanic whose heart was in the right place--unfortunately, his mouth wasn&apos;t. All this, plus a Valentine&apos;s Day recap from Ray&apos;s house, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, from the wreckage of an old MG comes a new superhero, "Captain Destructo," ready to dope-slap stinko drivers--if he can ever get his car to run. Meanwhile, with Valentine&apos;s Day approaching, is it time for Beth to dump her boyfriend, after he unjustly accused her of damaging his Mustang? Elsewhere, Albee wants to sell his car to his mother-in-law, but need to travel from Boston to Florida every month to change its bad spark plug. And, Roger&apos;s Toyota is emitting "Biblical" proportions of smoke after some oil changes. Is its "End Times" near? Also, should Donna leave her car running an extra 15 minutes on very cold nights to recharge the battery? What if 15 minutes turned into overnight, after her husband forgot to shut the car off? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, we celebrate Road Hog Day! Will Tommy&apos;s car cast a shadow, or can we look forward to an early Spring? Then we&apos;re off to Maine, where Shlomit&apos;s husband likes to drive with two feet. Does the fact that he&apos;s a good dancer make it okay? Also, Alok learned an expensive lesson about the dangers of playing "Hey guys, watch this," with his Mustang&apos;s clutch; Stephen&apos;s minivan doors are frozen shut, in part because his wife&apos;s chickens are occupying his garage; and on Stump the Chumps we find out if Tracy "helped" the abandoned car on her street lose its license plates, so it would get towed. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Barry&apos;s holiday road trip through South Carolina got more exciting when his wife noticed the road behind them was on fire. Was it coincidence, or was Barry&apos;s truck an unwitting arsonist? Farther South, things are a little less exciting for Rick in Florida. His PT Cruiser&apos;s explosions are only taking place under the hood. Also, have you ever heard of a Himalayan Exhaust Transfusion? Neither have we, but it might be a great way to start a dead car on a cold day. Or, it could just be a wacko theory. And, our on-call Physics Professor Wolfgang checks in on the great drafting debate. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, if one car drafts behind another to improve its gas mileage, does the car in front suffer? Tom and Ray&apos;s answer, or lack thereof, bring the late Physics Professor Tisza back from the grave, just to administer a dopeslap. Meanwhile, dopeslaps might also be in order for Jessica&apos;s mechanics, who will only discuss her car problems with her boyfriend, while ignoring her. Also, the solution to Nancy&apos;s Miata&apos;s hood problem lie in her local tanning salon; Melanie is about to learn a very expensive lesson about what her oil pressure light means; and, one listener offers the real definition of "primitive" 4-wheel drive. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

Elsewhere, Lewis&apos; VW dealer refused to honor a warranty repair, but re-evaluate his position when he learns Lewis is an IRS agent; Abbie&apos;s friend gave her the most wacko suggestion we&apos;ve ever heard to fix her car&apos;s alignment; and can Rachel hold us liable for the fender bender she caused because she was laughing at Car Talk? And, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray helped put out the fire in Red&apos;s convertible, or if they just fanned the flames. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Amy&apos;s head is spinning because her speedometer needle won&apos;t stop whizzing around in circles. Is a well-aimed rock her only hope of making it stop? Elsewhere, Suzanne&apos;s husband loves his vintage Ford Model A, but its gas fumes are destroying brain cells by the thousands. Also, Deanna&apos;s car battery tops New York City&apos;s "Must Steal" list; Romeo&apos;s muscle car lost its musle after a day of peeling out; and Allen&apos;s Volvo and TV are both turning themselves on at random times. Is it bad wiring, or a bad neighbor? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tommy&apos;s life-long aversion to work meets its match in the U.S. Army, and his old pal Sgt. McNeely. But, little did Tommy know that his ill-fated attempt to avoid target practice would one day become official government policy in the U.K. In matters automotive, Alex loves his truck so much, he refers to its oil type as "Type O-Negative," but it be time for it to meet its crusher; Fran can&apos;t decide whether to let her teenage daughter drive Grandpa&apos;s old Town Car, affectionately known as "The Party Barge"; and Tom and Ray try a new exit strategy for difficult questions: Diagnosis by Hypnosis. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Kate is desperate to get rid of her Chevy Cavalier, but her husband has vowed to keep it running for another 150,000 miles. Can Tom and Ray help her escape, and will it involve Uncle Vinny and a book of matches?&nbsp; Elsewhere, Sofia swears her Civic is making noise, but her mechanic says she&apos;s suffering from an "auditory hallucination"; and, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Christo can get his car running without banging on the fuel pump. Also, should Kate take her Corolla with her when she relocates from Ohio to St. Thomas? We know two mechanics/radio hosts who are willing to volunteer to join her. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Wendall&apos;s Bronco burst into flames and burnt to crisp, right after a 200 mile drive. Was it electrical? Fuel? A spouse holding an insurance policy?&nbsp; Elsewhere, Barry is hoping to find true love by fixing his co-worker&apos;s windshield wipers, and avoiding her jealous boyfriend; Donna needs a gracious way to tell her husband his theories about keeping her gas tank full are "boooooguuss"; and Deborah&apos;s lurching efforts to learn to drive a stick shift aren&apos;t being made any easier by her Civic&apos;s loud whine. Also, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Farmer Ben&apos;s manure spreader helped get his truck running smoothly again. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, after Jody&apos;s mechanics failed to fix her Honda, she&apos;s considering an alternative treatment--acupuncture. So, where is an Accord&apos;s ch&apos;i? Hopefully, not in the tires. Elsewhere, Steve promised his wife he&apos;d fix her Volvo, but after sneaking off to three diffferent mechanics, he still can&apos;t figure out the problem. Also, should Frances trade her trusty Miata for her Uncle&apos;s beloved, but un-trusworthy Porsche; is half-way good enough for the spark plug Chuck cross-threaded; and, can Rebecca make it home for the holidays in her ancient Chevy, or will the next NPR fundraiser be dedicated to buying her a plane ticket?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Sharon&apos;s been experiencing a series of bad hair days when she drives long distances. Unfortunately, she couldn&apos;t get through to "Follicle Talk," so she&apos;s turned to Tom and Ray. Can they stop laughing long enough to offer any useful advice? Elsewhere, Rick has a long list of reasons to justify adding a super charger to his Miata, and they&apos;re all bad; Doug&apos;s wife thinks the burning smell in his truck is dead bugs, and since he told her she&apos;s nuts, he&apos;s hoping it&apos;s anything else; and, Jon&apos;s mechanic is learning a lot about Jon&apos;s Accord--except how to fix it.

<description>This week&apos;s Car Talk features journeys both high and low. First, Tom and Ray salute aviation legend Larry Walters, who took flight in a lawn chair with balloons attached. Back on terra firma, Michaela and her siblings plan to take the family&apos;s 20-year-old car on a road trip from Oregon to, well, wherever the car finally dies. She&apos;s hoping to make it to Mexico. Tom and Ray think Salt Lake City might be a more reasonable target. Also, Mary Ann&apos;s mechanic&apos;s solution to her fuel problem could land him in jail; Heather&apos;s violating every scientific principle in getting her Subaru to start; and, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Dale had loose spark plugs, or if Tom and Ray had loose screws when they made the diagnosis. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, can Dave put two snow tires on his girlfriend&apos;s car, or does he need to buy a full set, as his tire dealer insists? Tom has a two-tire solution that qualify for next year&apos;s Nobel Prize in Bad Advice. Elsewhere, Cathryn&apos;s car is going "boom boom" whenever her mechanic isn&apos;t around to hear it; Helen&apos;s Toyota gained and then lost an extra 100 miles per tank of gas after she moved to Salt Lake City, and, can Keith install an air conditioner in his Geo Metro, and still make it up a hill?&nbsp; Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray got Pam&apos;s Volvo to stop smoking.

<description>This week on Car Talk, Jeryldine&apos;s car is infested with spiders, and she has no idea how to get rid of them. If she follows Tom and Ray&apos;s advice, her car will also be full of birds, bats, lizards, and, most likely, still spiders. Elsewhere, after losing his girlfriend and her car, Glen&apos;s friend suggested he browse his neighbors&apos; backyards for a replacement--car, that is. Will he find the Cabrio of his dreams, up on blocks? Also, Lacy thinks her Accord&apos;s engine is trying to escape, one piece at a time; Barry&apos;s dealer would be happy to work on his stuck parking brake, if Barry can only get the car to move from his garage; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray helped quiet Lisa&apos;s screeching Civic enough so she could talk to her cute neighbor. All this, plus the first Automotive Puzzler of the season, and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Nancy&apos;s three-year-old son is a puker. He gets car sick whenever Nancy drives on the winding Pacific Coast Highway, but comes through unscathed if Daddy is behind the wheel. Could the lead in Nancy&apos;s foot be the cause? Elsewhere, Sally&apos;s husband gave her a vintage Dodge Dart, but a brake problem has her wondering if he&apos;s really trying to bump her off. Also, Jake&apos;s car is turning into a Chia-Pontiac, growing hair in unusual places; Jason has three problems with his Dodge Colt, aside from the biggest problem--that he&apos;s driving a Dodge Colt; and Tom and Ray turn to you the audience for help figuring out the best way to drive over a washboard road. Is "minimal contact" a winning strategy? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, the Great Haircut Debate continues, as listeners weigh on whether it&apos;s ethical to use a roadside McDonalds&apos; restroom without buying anything.&nbsp; On the automotive front, Ellen&apos;s mechanic says he can tell her Dodge Caravan is dying by the smell of its oil. Tom and Ray smell a conspiracy between the mechanic and Ellen&apos;s husband, who wants a new Volvo. Also, how a car&apos;s transmission is like the family dog; a book from 1922 might help fix Nikki&apos;s noisy Jeep; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if John&apos;s sister duped him when she sold him his old VW Golf. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tom in Vermont would like to convince his son that towing a 1978 Land Cruiser cross-country with his girlfriend&apos;s small pickup truck is a bad idea. But, Tom&apos;s afraid that any words of caution will be thrown to the wind, just because of his "Dad" status. Should he try reverse psychology? Elsewhere, Lisa&apos;s hopes of meeting her cute neighbor have been complicated by the embarrassing screeching noise her Civic makes every morning; and Denise would like to find a way to keep her Ford Maverick running without a clothespin stuck in the carburetor. Also, since Leslie gave birth at a Chrysler dealership, should her minivan shopping begin and end there? All this, plus Opening Day for the new Puzzler season, and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>It&apos;s happened to all of us. You&apos;re on a long drive, when nature takes its course and you find yourself desperately needing to "take a haircut." Finally, a restroom appears, but it&apos;s inside a fast-food restaurant. This week on Car Talk, we tackle the moral quandary--if you use this restroom, are you obligated to get fries with that? Elsewhere, Tom is worried whether his Nissan&apos;s shocks can handle an upcoming road trip. Click and Clack are more worried that Tom plans to make said road trip with his mother and his girlfriend. Also, Erica&apos;s goal of getting her Camry to 200,000 miles hits a noisy obstacle; a clay-gathering trip turns smoky for Charlie&apos;s Explorer; and Bill&apos;s attempt to replace a broken belt with a pair of tights failed. Did he use the wrong size? The wrong color? Find out, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Terri&apos;s trying to convince her teenaged son not to buy himself a 1960&apos;s muscle car. Tom and Ray are ready to back her up with a trunk full of reasons why he&apos;s more likely to meet girls if he&apos;s driving a 1986 Volvo (with mis-matched hubcaps). But their efforts all be undone when they turn to Tom&apos;s son Alex to back them up. Elsewhere, Deena&apos;s hoping a horn transplant will cause other drivers to mistake her Chevy Nova for a diesel truck; Thomas is wondering if his local Quickie Lube guy was just trying to clean out his wallet when when he offered to clean Thomas&apos; fuel injectors; and should Roe tell the friend who loaned her his Civic for three months that she spent a good portion of that time driving with the parking brake on? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Click and Clack delve deep into scientific inquiry on the expanding American rump. The fruits of their labor? A new way to measure the human derriere. Presenting... the "Pinkwater," after Tom and Ray&apos;s pal, his rotundity, Daniel Pinkwater. Also, Kathleen has a moral, ethical and economic dilemma: to buy a SUV or buck the big car trend? And Matthew is struggling with his car washing technique. He&apos;s striving for spotless perfection on his parent&apos;s Voyager. Could the Shawalla be the answer to all of his car-cleansing woes? All this and much more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Suzi bought a Porsche 911, partly to help her bond with her male colleagues. Unfortunately, she can&apos;t answer any of their questions about the car, and things are getting awkward around the water cooler. Can Tom and Ray give Suzi a quick Porsche 101 seminar, or are they even more clueless than she is? Earlier, our favorite brat, Melissa Peterson returns to remind Tom and Ray she still hates them... but as long as they&apos;re all on the phone together, would they mind helping convince her mother that her new scooter is safe? Andy&apos;s Infiniti&apos;s active suspension has become a bit hyper-active; Larry took his car for an oil change and almost got taken for new axles; and, in a follow-up from last week, Kirsten returns to tell us how the government plans to treat her beloved CRX while she&apos;s in Kosovo for two years. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>We all know Tom and Ray&apos;s dismal record diagnosing car problems, so this week on Car Talk we find out how they did with something a little smaller--a bread maker. Jeff from New Mexico is back for a round of Stump the Chumps to tell us if the Magliozzi recipe made his loaves come out looking less like hockey pucks. Elsewhere, Vivek is puzzled by the puddle that forms under his seat when he uses his air conditioner; Leslie&apos;s husband told her she&apos;s ruining her car by not straightening the wheels when she parks; and Kirsten wants to know what questions to ask the guys who will be storing her Honda while she goes to Kosovo for two years. Our first question? Can Tommy sleep in it when his wife throws him out of the house. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Savannah wants her car to shine. Literally. Given that it&apos;s a Plymouth Sundance, she faces a daunting task! A plethora of rhinestones will make this baby glitter but how does she affix it all without leaving a sparkling trail down the interstate? Also, Car Talk history is made as a caller asks Tom and Ray to settle a marital dispute by doing... nothing! Also, Larry&apos;s Lincoln died, and the CIA might be interested in whether he fixes it or not; Maxine learned the old mechanic&apos;s adage that a free brake job means never having to say you&apos;re sorry; and one diagnosis leads another caller to congratulate Tom and Ray for the finest piece of bamboozling ever. All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week&apos;s Car Talk kicks off with a harrowing tale of one man&apos;s journey into Dante&apos;s supplemental Circle of Hell: the local health club, where he spends one week at the merciless hands of Tanya the Trainer. Then it&apos;s off to Missouri, where Jon is concerned about whether the smell in his Chevy S-10 is coming from the truck-- or his fiancee. Elsewhere, "Mom" and her teenaged son are arguing over whether the best way to cool a car and keep 40 pounds of meat frozen in 90 degree weather is by turning the heat on full blast; and Rita&apos;s intermittent air conditioner problem has convinced her mechanic that she&apos;s just looking for an excuse to visit. And, on Stump the Chumps we find out if a Volkswagen really was equipped with a "lard-butt indicator" that made the horn blow at random times. All this and lots more,this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, all was well with Karen&apos;s Honda until her boyfriend gave it&nbsp; a tune-up--which promptly turned on the Check Engine light. We&apos;ll just skip past the question of whether he messed up, and go right to trying to figure out what he messed up. Elsewhere in Civic-land, Anna came out of work one day to discover an unwanted passenger in her car: a white rat. How did it get there, and how can she ever go near her car again? Also, our Physicist-on-Call Wolfgang checks in to help clarify, and de-bogusify, Ray&apos;s "dispersion" theory on the odd behavior of a keyless remote; and is Lara&apos;s starting problem really caused by her turning the key too fast? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dave has discovered an electrical anomaly: his Audi&apos;s keyless remote works better when he points it at his chin rather than his car. Fortunately, he&apos;s come to the right place…for a completely bogus explanation. Elsewhere, Brett&apos;s Camry is giving him enough electrical shocks to turn him into a walking Van de Graaff Generator; Spencer learned why you should never touch your lug nuts in public on a hot day; and Beth&apos;s Accord is exhibiting all the symptoms of a bad clutch, with just one problem: it&apos;s an automatic. Also, in a follow-up to last week&apos;s show, we hear from Tracy, whose girlfriend&apos;s parents offered to buy them a car if they got married. Did he get the girl, and the Lexus to boot? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Elisa&apos;s parents are so anxious for her to marry her live-in boyfriend, that they&apos;ve offered to buy her a new car if Elissa and her beau tie the knot. Is this an offer she can&apos;t refuse, or will she be opening herself up to a lifetime of parental meddling--which not be so bad if it means a lifetime of new cars. Elsewhere, newly employed Katherine would like to buy a new car, but is worried that she have trouble making the payments on it, after rear-ending her boss&apos; car on her second day. Also, Jay&apos;s wondering if a non-working tachometer can substitute for a non-working speedometer in his BMW; Chris&apos; car has developed a seasonal allergy to starting; and Ann offers Case Study #265,498 of why you should never listen to your father when it comes to cars. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, how did the chicken get to church? That&apos;s what&apos;s puzzling Sara in Ohio, after her chicken stowed away somewhere outside the cab of her truck for a two-hour drive. Also, while we applaud DIY repair efforts, Josh in Montana have gone too far when he tried to figure out the source of his truck&apos;s rattle by driving with his head out the door, looking underneath. Yes, the truck was moving. Yes, he was driving. And no, we aren&apos;t kidding. Elsewhere, Cathy is trying to figure out why her Sentra is going through head gaskets faster than Tommy goes through ex-wives; mechanic John is trying to figure out the labor rate for evil ex-girlfriends; and on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray help Mike take ownership of his father-in-law&apos;s Lincoln? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, after having his Dodge Omni crash into his parents&apos; deck and run over him, Steve has decided it&apos;s time to deal with his car&apos;s quirk-- you can turn the car off and remove the key, while it&apos;s still in Drive. Will he go for a simple repair, or will he take Tom&apos;s advice to handcuff himself to the shifter so he&apos;ll never again forget to put it in Park? Elsewhere, Teri be able to put her baking skills to use by creating a baguette-trunk interface to quiet her Accord; Nancy is concerned that she have inherited the two-footed driving gene from her mom and aunt; and could a full-on Nikita Khrushchev shoe-banging help fix Eric&apos;s air conditioner? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, the headliner in Cheryl&apos;s Chevy is falling down, and causing a series of bad-hair days. She&apos;d like to fashion a replacement. Can Tom and Ray offer any interior decorating tips, or just suggest she use a better cream rinse? Elsewhere, Brent&apos;s Audi is leaking very expensive "mineral oil" power steering fluid. Does he need to spend big bucks to fix his steering, or can he try a cheaper fluid, like, say, Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil? Also, Keller&apos;s got a wobbling wheel, but a much too interesting name and Graduate major to get a clear answer; and on Stump the Chumps we find out if Tom and Ray correctly diagnosed Tim&apos;s misdirected air conditioner, and if Tim was able to re-direct the repair bill to his Mom. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, why does the horn in John&apos;s wife&apos;s Golf start blowing when he drives it? John&apos;s wife thinks he&apos;s setting off the "lardbutt indicator" under the driver&apos;s seat. Has VW really come up with something so sophisticated? Elsewhere, Wendy has discovered that giving up her beloved Super Beetle has done great harm to her social life. She used to be able to meet guys while working on its (many) problems. But, her new Toyota is both too reliable and too complicated. Also, Sara learns an expensive lesson in why you shouldn&apos;t let a Physics Grad student fix your fuel pump--with you and your dog stuck in the car while it&apos;s on he lift; and can Jeff safely use Coleman fuel in his Civic next time he gets stranded while camping? All this and more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Denice&apos;s European friend is coming to the U.S., and bringing his Citroen with him. (We don&apos;t know if it will fit in the overhead luggage bin, or if he&apos;ll have to check it.) He&apos;s hoping to drive it from New York to Minnesota, but will the lack of French mechanics and parts leave him uttering, "Mon Dieu!" if he breaks down? Elsewhere, Jann&apos;s wondering how to get a dealer to let her test-drive a new car with a 77-pound dog that&apos;s prone to car sickness; Keller is preparing to sell his VW Bug, but there&apos;s that pesky matter of the missing floor on the passenger side; and Steve&apos;s Check Engine light comes on, only when he parks his Civic at the Pentagon. Has his car cracked a classified code? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Linda&apos;s husband proudly told her he&apos;d "fixed" her Volvo--by cutting the roof off and turning it into something resembling a convertible. Is her car still safe to drive, without a football helmet? Meanwhile, Jeff relocated from New Orleans to New Mexico, and the higher altitude is wreaking havoc on his automatic breadmaker. Apparently Martha Stewart&apos;s line was busy this week, so we&apos;ll see if Tom and Ray can bring some life back to his loaves. We&apos;ve also got a few bona fide car problems: Robert&apos;s Subaru keeps overheating, despite him replacing just about every part that could be responsible; Gary wants to know if he can take a 1300-mile road trip, all while down one cylinder in his Isuzu; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray correctly diagnosed Anne&apos;s growling minivan, and if her husband&apos;s vasectomy reversal has been fruitful. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, a day of maple sugaring came to a bad end for John, when he spilled a 5-gallon container of syrup in his car. How can he get the sticky stuff out of the seatbelt holders, short of slipping a stack of pancakes in there to sop it up?&nbsp; Also, a classic Car Talk driveway moment, literally, as Jason pours gas down his truck&apos;s carburetor, and tries to start it on the air. Will the 20th time be the charm? And on Stump the Chumps, we find out whether Tom and Ray correctly diagnosed Paula&apos;s whistling Bronco.

<description>This week on Car Talk, Ian&apos;s Neon has discovered the Fountain of Youth. When the car goes over 50 MPH, the odometer begins running backwards. Can Tom and Ray figure out what&apos;s going on before the car drives itself all the way back to the assembly plant? Elsewhere, automotive history is made in Oregon, as Jim becomes the first person ever to feel guilty about selling a used car that&apos;s performing too well for its new owner; on Stump the Chumps, we find out Dana&apos;s jerking Jetta was really due to the dreaded, "Shmutz on the Clutch"; and Tom and Ray finally get judged by their peers, as an 8th grade class reviews our show. Could Roger Ebert have topped, "I think the show is a good idea because people like listening to idiots"? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

He bragged to a customer about a car&apos;s torque and horsepower, the customer asked LaDell to explain the difference… and he&apos;s still waiting for an answer. Elsewhere, Liberty&apos;s Nissan is sending a clear message: Give me new ball joints, or I give you death; Tony&apos;s 17-year-old son says the fumes from Dad&apos;s Saab are responsible for him dropping AP history and not cleaning his room anymore; and, Liz is wondering whether her trusty old Toyota truck can serve as a two-story home for her sled dogs. And, from our Expository Writing Department, we have a few choice metaphors and similes, including, "He fell for her like his heart was a mob informant, and she was the East River." All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Donna&apos;s husband refuses to part with his 1977 Dodge Aspen. It runs like a champ, but looks like the 1962 New York Mets. It&apos;s so beat up that, during a recent storm, more hailstones made it through holes in the car than actually hit the body. Is this a job for Uncle Nunzio&apos;s sabotage team, or Mr. Gigi&apos;s beautification squad? Elsewhere, David&apos;s Nissan is jerking while accelerating, making it look like he doesn&apos;t know how to drive stick, and worse, tossing his dog all over the truck; Pam is so concerned about her T-Bird&apos;s creaking noise that she waited five years to call us abut it; and&nbsp; could Tom&apos;s diagnosis of an overheating Subaru really cause MIT to revoke his diploma? Oh, and by the way, if your name is Homer Handelburg, have we got an offer for you! All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, John is wondering whether &apos;tis nobler not to spray water on his fellow drivers at the risk of increasing his new car&apos;s risk of rust--which is a poetic way of asking, should he get mud flaps installed on his new car? Elsewhere, Manny&apos;s Chevy S-10 in having trouble adjusting to its new home. Ever since he moved, it won&apos;t start after an overnight rain; and Piali&apos;s steering wheel is making noises that she thinks are scary, but her husband thinks are hilarious. Also, former Ferrari driver Steve wonders how he can adjust to a post-divorce life of driving a car with cloth seats; Connie&apos;s looking for the perfect car for a road trip from Bellingham, WA to Rio de Janiero; and when Lin&apos;s mechanic told her, "your rear end&apos;s gonna fall off"--we&apos;re pretty sure he was referring to her Explorer. At least, we hope he was referring to her Explorer. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Ben&apos;s band is about to embark on a cross-country tour. They can&apos;t get a van, so the vehicle of choice is Ben&apos;s ancient Volvo 145. Will they make it to any gigs on time, or will they be performing solely for Volvo mechanics across the U.S.? Elsewhere, Rush&apos;s Land Rover is now infused with the aroma of rancid butter, after a stick of it melted on his dashboard, and coursed its way through his entire ventilation system. Will he ever be able to get rid of the stink, without the use of a flame thrower? Also, Anwen&apos;s fuel pump is making noise, despite her mechanic&apos;s insistence that it&apos;s fine; physics teacher Mike needs a better answer than "magic" to explain rear view mirrors; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Prashanth introduced his new wife to his old Corolla, and if honesty earned him a trip to Divorce Court. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Kerry&apos;s Boston condo came with one unfortunate feature--a large crater in the parking lot that fills with water every time it rains. She&apos;s worried that driving through this "pit of despair" every day is killing her Honda. Are those fears warranted, and does Kerry need the number for Vinny&apos;s Late Night Concrete Services, Inc.? Elsewhere, Vincent "inherited" his daughter&apos;s Jeep, along with its tendency to shake, rattle and die above 2,000 RPM; Ben needs help convincing his girlfriend that cars are impervious to wind chill factors--especially German cars; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray helped lead Kathy&apos;s son to victory in the Pinewood Derby--and, why they didn&apos;t. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Kate and Aaron&apos;s long-distance relationship has come to a road block. Aaron is afraid to drive, so Kate&apos;s doing all the traveling, and it&apos;s become a bit of a pain in the butt--figuratively, and literally. Can Tom and Ray help her get Aaron behind the wheel, or is this relationship headed for the crusher? Elsewhere, Erin inherited her Grandpa&apos;s Impala, and among its dozen or so problems, the most amusing is that when she turns on her high-beams, the directional signals don&apos;t work; Tony&apos;s sleeping on the sofa after two unsuccessful repairs to his wife&apos;s Subaru, and Strike Three might send him and his sleeping bag to the garage; and, Steve is wondering why his trusty Ford Ranger is suddenly causing boat payments, three at a time. Also, on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray help Sam quiet his Accord long enough to sell it? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, James thought he got a good deal when he bought his neighbor&apos;s Cadillac--and that&apos;s before the cash rebate, in the form of $3,200 hidden in the trunk. Should he hand the money over, or tear the rest of the car apart in search of more? Later, Tom and Ray are vexed by two noises: Scott thinks someone&apos;s playing a French Horn under the hood of his Explorer, and Jane keeps checking her Civic&apos;s trunk for the passenger who&apos;s banging on the sides. Also, Barry&apos;s lived a car-free life into his 30&apos;s, but his relocation to L.A. has him wondering if it&apos;s time to give in. But will a car lead him directly to Botox injections? And our deep question of the week: do we really need a Click AND a Clack? And if not, which Magliozzi&apos;s moot? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Jim loves his 1957 Morris Minor, except for one minor inconvenience--its 36 horsepower isn&apos;t enough to get it up hills, so his passengers have to get out and push. Does Jim need to keep a few Clydesdales on hand for an occasional tow? Elsewhere, Mo had to drive her boss&apos;s Saab, and the next day it needed a few hundred dollars&apos; worth of clutch repairs. Should she be dreading her next employee review? Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Dr. Paul&apos;s life no longer resembles a Country-Western song; sisters Kathy and Jackie debate the merits of using mothballs to improve gas mileage; and could the secret to a happy marriage be two simple words: "Yes, dear"?&nbsp; All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Wendy&apos;s Honda was fogging up, but only when her husband was in the car with her. Tom and Ray postulated that hubby&apos;s breathing was causing the problem, and suggested Wendy experiment by having him breathe through a snorkel, out an open window. Now Wendy&apos;s back for Stump the Chumps with a full report on the Great Snorkel Experiment. Elsewhere, Adrienne found the perfect birthday present for her husband--700 pounds of rocks! Can her Saab handle the 300-mile trip, or does she need to transport one rock at a time? Also, Steve&apos;s DIY brake repair has resulted in his truck taking out two car ports; Matt&apos;s CRV is not putting out heat, which is a big problem, since Matt is in Anchorage; and, Rain got a rude Welcome Home from her Acura, after leaving it parked for three months: mold, and a thriving ant colony. All this, plus a tale of a very smart car radio, and lots more, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Kathy is "helping" her son build his Pinewood Derby race car, and is looking for a few design tips. Can two MIT grads-- one of whom failed Physics twice-- lead her to Victory Row, or is this Cub Scout Den Mother barking up the wrong radio show? Elsewhere, Sophie thinks her Saab is laughing at her, and not just because it&apos;s delighted by her French accent; Ainsley&apos;s husband won&apos;t let her take her Honda to the car wash because he&apos;s worried it&apos;ll melt the Epoxy that&apos;s holding the car together; and Richard won Employee of the Month by driving 95 mph to deliver his boss&apos; passport to the airport. But, will he be forced to sell his plaque to fix the problems that have plagued his Jeep ever since? And, our Historic, Folkloric Question of the Week comes from Julie: why do we drive on the right, if we&apos;re a former British colony? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Steve moved to Chicago for a job and a girlfriend. He lost both. But what&apos;s confusing him is why he didn&apos;t lose his ride, as well. His Acura was the only car that didn&apos;t get towed from a parking lot during a party. Did the parking deities take pity on him? Elsewhere, Chuck decided to cut his air conditioner belt because it was smoking, and now find himself on the FBI&apos;s Most Wanted list; and Heidi find out why her Check Engine light is blinking, if she can make it through a few Magliozzi detours into Kirchoff&apos;s laws, MIT admissions, and the U.S. Army. Also, the final chapter of the Suzy Saga. She made it home to Carlsbad, but did she manage to make it across Mexico in her Vanagon? Did she even make it TO Mexico in her Vanagon?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tracy&apos;s husband has a brilliant (his word) approach to reducing brake wear--by stomping on them at the last possible second. Tracy thinks he&apos;s nuts and so does their dog-- he&apos;s afraid to get in the car. Elsewhere, Red was ready to live the dream in the &apos;75 Pontiac he bought off a front lawn. Alas, his maiden voyage was cut short when the carpet burst into flames! Also, Wendy&apos;s Honda fogs up whenever her husband (and only her husband) rides in it; Linnea&apos;s Jetta has a squealing problem when she backs up; and could Peter&apos;s faulty cooling fan relax an entire nation, by introducing the Mandatory Meditative Minute? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dana&apos;s Jetta is shaking violently in 1st Gear. Could the culprit be the dreaded (and highly technical) "schmutz on the clutch?" Meanwhile, in Dallas, Dr. Paul&apos;s life has been a Country-Western song: he totaled his car, his wife left him, and his dog died. Can Tom and Ray help him choose a new ride that will help him find a new love---and a new dog? Also, Science Museum educator Seniz needs a lesson from the space shuttle to understand the noise her Civic is making; Mark has discovered a new driving technique with the double bonus of being more efficient and making his wife thinks he&apos;s completely nuts; and on Stump the Chumps, did one answer solve three problems for Ed and his Jeep? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, what could make a Fiat&apos;s gas mileage increase exponentially over a few days? A holiday miracle, or might it be the same earthly reason said Fiat&apos;s mileage then decreases by the same amount? And, does it have anything to do with those guys laughing their butts off in the corner? Meanwhile, Rachel need a miracle to keep her Camry&apos;s engine from jumping into the passenger seat, though opening her wallet might work just as well. Also, Delena&apos;s decided that 6 years is long enough to live with her Civic&apos;s oil leak; Darren is convinced his wife is subconsciously trying to kill his Land Rover; and, Rich wants to know if he can convert his Cavalier into a convertible. Sure, as long as he doesn&apos;t want to ever drive it again! And, Ray finally asks Tom the question that&apos;s been on everyone&apos;s minds for 25 years: What are you doing here? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Suzy&apos;s drive across Mexico is off to a rocky start. She hasn&apos;t even crossed the border, and her Vanagon is already making a new noise that could foreshadow the Death of a Transmission. Will Tom and Ray counsel her to turn back, or just to go shopping for a good pair of noise-canceling headphones? Elsewhere, Patricia&apos;s Subaru is having troubles starting, and exacerbating the problem is a large buffalo grazing between her and her car; and Katie&apos;s right leg is showing its displeasure with her new Volvo by going numb when she drives it. Also, does Neil&apos;s son&apos;s decision to play the double bass mean Neil&apos;s on a one-way street to Minivan Land, and is Kelly&apos;s boyfriend nuts for insisting on warming up his truck for 10 minutes in 50 degree weather? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, nothing says, "I love you" better than… four new Michelins? Patty is dismayed by her boyfriend&apos;s plan to give her tires this Christmas. Can Tom and Ray help her convince him to think a wee bit more romantically? Meanwhile, in Our Fair City, Peter&apos;s friend showed his devotion by climbing into Peter&apos;s trunk when it wouldn&apos;t close. He succeeded in closing it, and when they realized he had the only key, spent the next several hours inside. Said friend is a Graduate Student at MIT. (Why are we not surprised?) Also, Ed&apos;s worried his radiator might blow bubbles, after he misdirected a bottle of wiper fluid; Laura need to find out if a transmission is in the alimony agreement with her ex-husband/ex-mechanic; and we learn what happens when a clutch-wrecker tries to change his ways. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, "Alternator? We don&apos;t need no stinkin&apos; alternator!" Suzy is about to embark on a drive across Mexico in her Vanagon. Will Tom and Ray have any advice on how to prepare, aside from a pre-trip screening of Treasure of the Sierra Madre? Elsewhere, Michael stands to inherit his father-in-law&apos;s Lincoln, if he can figure out why it&apos;s stalling; Henry needs to know if he can still rely on his coat-hanger wielding, shade-tree mechanic pal Sammy, after a brake job failed to make Henry&apos;s Colt stop pulsing; and on Stump the Chumps, did Erica spring for a new transmission or a bungee cord to keep her Forester from popping out of gear? And, car dealers once again battle it out with members of Congress for the dubious title of Least Honest Profession. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Diana has a new boyfriend, and a Stanza that&apos;s begun chewing up brake pads at an alarming rate. What are the chances these two facts are not a coincidence? Oh, maybe 100%? Elsewhere, Nan&apos;s trying to figure out how to get her new husband to share his garage with her Accord, and why the Accord won&apos;t start after it&apos;s parked in said garage. Any guesses on which question Tom and Ray might have an answer for? Also, Bob&apos;s got an exposed airbag in his Sonata and, as a result, a family that&apos;s embarrassed to be seen in the car with him. His proposed solution? Duct tape, of course! And, did Ben make a big mistake by giving into the lure of the Jaguar Fatale? All this, plus the truth about lying in Italy, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, John thinks his employee Steve is a great guy. However, Steve have destroyed the clutch on the company truck, after only a few hours of driving. Enter Tom and Ray, prepared to stage a driving intervention with Steve, and maybe handle his employee performance review at the same time. Elsewhere, Faith just relocated from Maine to Alaska because she was longing for snow. Her Subaru seems displeased with the move, though, as it&apos;s begun making an alarming noise. Also, Susan swears that changing gears on her Saturn is like shifting through a bowl of Cream of Wheat, but her boyfriend swears she&apos;s crazy; and, speaking crazy, would you drive across country in a Ford Focus, with a boyfriend, three dogs, and two cats? Shelly&apos;s planning on trying, unless Tom and Ray can come up with a better plan--and there only be a million or so better plans. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, do birds aim their droppings? Ross in Seattle traded his green Acura for a white one, and suddenly he&apos;s scraping heaps of avian deposits off his roof. Elsewhere, Jenny&apos;s Sebring has a water retention problem in the driver&apos;s door, which is giving her mechanics a good laugh; Selene&apos;s about to kill her budding Hollywood career, and terrify her cat, by imitating the noises her Cadillac is making; and Dan has survived four years of driving in New York City, without Reverse. Has he earned a huge repair bill, on top of his spot in the Parallel Parking Hall of Fame? And, we know it&apos;s the season to be thankful, but why is a colonectal surgeon grateful to Tom and Ray for boosting his business? All that, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, how many thousands of dollars can one hour of lousy car advice pump into an ailing economy? Well, when that hour starts with a Saab owner who&apos;s going to be transmission shopping, we be able to match the Gross Domestic Product of Guinea Bissau. Or better. Things take a turn for the bearish, though, when Jacob scores a free do-over on his timing belt replacement-- and when Lee&apos;s Lincoln turns out to need a new "Whoop Tube." (How do you figure costs of replacing an imaginary part?) Happily, Laura brings us back on track. She loves her Camry so much, she can&apos;t wait to dump it and get something more suited to her growing dog. Elsewhere, Joanne is trying to teach her teenage kids to drive a stick without causing daily whiplash outbreaks; and, on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray help save Mark&apos;s socks from being soaked by transmission fluid? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Linda has no problems driving her Forester. But when she&apos;s hauling her grandkids in her daughter&apos;s minivan, she can&apos;t take off from a stop without the car sounding like she&apos;s drag racing. Can Tom and Ray help her, before the kids tattle on her? Elsewhere, Charlotte and her husband decided to liven up their lives by adopting four little kids. And to make things more exciting, they&apos;re thinking a beater car in the backyard might make a good playhouse for the tykes. Also, Travis can&apos;t even look at his Land Cruiser without it overheating; Tammie thinks her Buick is having territorial issues, because it growls when anyone walks near it; and Peter needs to retrieve an escaped hamster from his Acura&apos;s dashboard, before it becomes a permanent, or decaying, resident. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week&apos;s Car Talk features our favorite road trip story, ever. It stars Dave and his girlfriend; travels from Alaska to Bemidji, Minnesota; and the featured cast includes an overheating Chevy Cavalier, a crescent wrench with no sockets, an old campfire grill, and-- yes-- a zit on Dave&apos;s forehead. As for the plot, well, you&apos;ll just have to hear for yourself. Elsewhere, Ann thinks her Buick&apos;s radio is trying to "Gaslight" her into thinking she has a hearing problem; Jed&apos;s learning why taking his Chevy Suburban to Budapest not have been such a great idea after all; and, Alana&apos;s Civic is spitting gas back at her. Also, Tommy provides a great lesson in how NOT to start a car that&apos;s been sitting untouched for four years--that is, unless you&apos;re a big fan of billowing black smoke. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, the untended 3:00 AM car alarm is one of the great nuisances of urban life. But, for Mike in DC, the problem is especially annoying. The offending car is parked at a nearby embassy, and the Police won&apos;t go near it. Does Mike need to get a vote from the UN Security Council to finally get a good night&apos;s sleep? Meanwhile, Twila in Missouri is hoping Tom and Ray can intervene, and break the news to her brother that his truck got smashed while under her watch--even though it wasn&apos;t her fault. Also, a fiery trip down a mountain teaches Jerry the importance of downshifting; a 15-year-old asks whether eccentricity is a matter of Nature or Nurture; and on Stump the Chumps we find out why Carla in Alaska&apos;s truck could only climb hills backwards.&nbsp; All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Mike is about to leave Anchorage, and embark on a two-year sailing trip. But, he doesn&apos;t know if his lovingly restored Land Rover can survive two Alaskan Winters without him. Will Cosmoline or late-night TV save the day? Elsewhere, Eileen is having trouble starting her Celica, and thinks the problem is related to her "cute little foot," and Darryl&apos;s Isuzu only runs smoothly when the Check Engine light comes on. Also, Amanda&apos;s dad gifted her an Infiniti which is way too nice for her, her infant, and her dog, and she needs an exit strategy. And, will a strategically placed blanket and light bulb really reduce Judy&apos;s engine wear by 95%? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, medical school student Christine is having a little trouble remembering things--happily, she&apos;s not leaving any forceps in patients, but she is repeatedly leaving her keys locked in her Camry. Does she need to gift all of her classmates with copies of her key? Elsewhere, Judy and her husband went car shopping and agreed on everything except the color. So who better to ask to adjudicate than two guys who are color blind? Also, Jose hopes his MIT degree has prepared him to tackle a leaky valve cover; Sarah faces one more Anchorage winter with a recalcitrant heater;&nbsp; and on Stump the Chumps we welcome back Dickie, who couldn&apos;t figure out why water was shooting out of his girlfriend&apos;s steering column. All this, plus a new Puzzler from the Matchstick series, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, welcome to foliage season! Tourists are descending on New England, and locals like Kurt have plenty of time to sit in traffic, developing theories about the drivers clogging his roads. Hey, if wacko Auto-Sociological musings keep his blood pressure down, who are we to argue? Elsewhere, Angela&apos;s about to get some sour news about the sweet smell emanating from her dashboard; no good jump start goes unpunished for Bridget, after a friend accused her of doing $1,300 of damage by charging the battery backwards; and, is Ed really about to turn to electric shock therapy to keep his beloved cats from marking their territory on his cars? Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Kate acted on her Matrix buyer&apos;s remorse. All this, plus a new Puzzler from the inky shadows of the World War II series, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Glen&apos;s summer vacation got a little more exciting when his rental car caught on fire, after he spilled oil on the manifold. He escaped unscathed, but did the car? And, more importantly, did he &apos;fess up to the rental company? Elsewhere, Joann&apos;s getting a foot bath from her Grand Caravan; Ed&apos;s Jetta needs a few seconds to convince itself it really wants to go into Reverse; and Sue&apos;s wondering why PAM cooking spray quieted her noisy fan belt. But our deepest question of the week comes from Vera in New Orleans: Is it legal to drive barefoot? All this, plus the truth about duct tape, a new Puzzler from the Baseball Algebraic series, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, listeners weigh in on the great Car Naming debate, including one very persuasive cautionary tale about why you shouldn&apos;t name your car after your wife. Then it&apos;s off to Wisconsin, where Martha&apos;s unnamed Chevy van has developed a nasty habit of acting like it&apos;s run out of gas; and to Ohio where Fatymah&apos;s beloved Civic, "Little Red," has a big transmission problem. Elsewhere, Kate&apos;s family trip turns into a terror-filled ride down Mount St. Helens, all because nobody bothered to read the owner&apos;s manual in their rental; Matt&apos;s brother talked him into a DIY timing belt replacement on Mother&apos;s Day… and it&apos;s still not finished. And, could Elizabeth&apos;s noisy Volvo get her expelled from college? All this, plus the return of the Puzzler, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, the best defense is--a boooogus scientific explanation? Hey, it&apos;s always worked for Tom and Ray! Katie&apos;s roommate cited the Bernoulli Effect to explain why he gunned the engine to dislodge her stuck car door. She told him where he could stick his Bernoulli. Will Tom and Ray back her up? Elsewhere, Ray has a perfect diagnosis for Heidi&apos;s noisy 4Runner--if he can convince her that a "shugga shugga" is actually a groan, and Frank need a box of doughnuts to help him fix his Forester&apos;s creaky window himself. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Steve&apos;s cross-country bachelor party road trip in a &apos;66 Econoline ended with him taking his vows on a tow truck; and, the most perplexing question of the week: Why on earth would anyone steal the seats out of a 1999 Miata?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Robert is a "Car Namer." More specifically, he&apos;s always given his vehicles female monikers. So imagine his shock when he learned that his truck&apos;s previous owner had already named it... Mark! Can Robert change his truck&apos;s name (and gender!) without giving it an identity crisis? Then we dig into the Department of Odd Noises. Elisha&apos;s Honda is making a sound she describes as "a mouse wearing stilettos, doing a tap dance on a marble floor." And, Maureen&apos;s looking for a way to compensate her mechanic who suffered head injuries while working on her car. Can baked goods make him forget about a permanently damaged forehead?

<description>This week on Car Talk, remember Heather&apos;s Volvo that was dying at high altitudes? Tom and Ray get an update on Helmut the Cranky Mechanic, who have caused the problem.&nbsp; Did he finally &apos;fess up? Find out on Stump the Chumps. Elsewhere, Elizabeth thought a herd of cows was following her on her Summer roadtrip, until she realized the mooing was coming from her air conditioner; Bruce just learned why you shouldn&apos;t buy a used car from your brother; and Wendy&apos;s wondering if a vintage Beetle can handle a drive from Kansas to Washnigton DC in less than, say, 6 months.

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tom and Ray discuss the ever-so-important car accessories: butt coolers and heaters! Cupholders and fuzzy dice are so passé--keeping your derriere at the optimum temperature is now what it takes to be au courant. At least, if you&apos;re Ray Magliozzi. Then, we delve into other pressing automotive issues... like how often should you clean bird poop off your car? And when it comes to breaking in a new vehicle, do you have to drive like a blue-haired old lady? And, when you leave a gas station with the pump nozzle in your gas tank, can you sue for emotional damage? Tom and Ray consider these slightly automotive but highly pressing ethical questions, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tom and Ray dip into the mailbag to answer some personal questions from listeners. To name a few: Which brother snorts? Was either one wedgied as a kid? And, has either brother ever been hauled off to jail? We&apos;re not sure why anyone wants to know this stuff, either, but fortunately there&apos;s also time for some car questions. There&apos;s Debra, who can&apos;t turn her key in the ignition until she pushes the car forward; Rane, who&apos;s worried that the engine might be about to fall out of her Isuzu; and Prashanth, whose wife is coming over from India, but hop on the first plane back after she sees his banged up Corolla. Also, what&apos;s a husband to do when he turns his wife&apos;s car into Florida&apos;s newest swamp? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Ann&apos;s car is emitting a mysterious gummy substance through the vents. Her mechanic doens&apos;t know what it is, or where it&apos;s coming from. But, that hasn&apos;t stopped him from telling Ann it&apos;ll cost her $1000 to fix it! Talk about psychic powers! Elsewhere, 13-year old Thomas was gifted a &apos;94 Altima for helping a car dealer. Now, he needs Tom and ray&apos;s help convincing him Mom to let him drive it when he gets his license in three years. Also, Alita needs help keeping the Truck That Wouldn&apos;t Die from, uh, dying;&nbsp; Amy&apos;s been convinced that her Civic&apos;s starting problem is a Honda safety feature that was so special they only used it on her car; and on Stump the Chumps we find out why Jean&apos;s Porsche almost rolled off a cliff while in Park.

<description>This week on Car Talk, Andy borrowed his Dad&apos;s Buick for a romantic drive to the country. All was right with the world, until he ran out of gas. A Good Samaritan gave him a few gallons, but somehow Andy managed to drop a straw into the gas tank. Now, Dad&apos;s car is running lousy, and Andy needs to know if one straw could cause a few boat payments worth of damage. Elsewhere, Brian is trying to decide whether his Mercedes&apos; new noise is the sound of it playing Taps; Mary wants to coax a few more miles from her Altima&apos;s slipping clutch; and Gail wants to retro-fit a vintage VW Beetle with air conditioning--maybe a nice window unit from Home Depot? Also, on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray successfully diagnose Susanne&apos;s overheating Mazda? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Sherry and her husband discovered they couldn&apos;t mount their bike rack on the roof their new Lincoln Town Car. How are they going to haul around their kids and bikes? His solution is a Minivan. Hers? A Town Car Stretch Limo. Can Tom and Ray bring a return to domestic tranquility? Elsewhere, Michele&apos;s husband thinks she has too many keys dangling from her ignition, and has made the most dire threat: either she divests of a few keys, or his Mom&apos;s moving in with them. Also, just a few weeks after a Freon refill, Michelle&apos;s Escort&apos;s back to blowing hot air; Brad&apos;s adding an alarming amount of fluid to his Camry&apos;s clutch; and Pradeep is being slowly driven crazy by the cell phone he dropped into his BMW&apos;s duct work. Will Tom and Ray have any suggestions for removing it that are more helpful than, say, turning the car upside down and shaking it? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Karmen&apos;s husband is a "burper." At the gas pump, he shakes the car to get the air out, and more gas in. Karmen thinks this is wacko--which it is--but is her nozzle technique any less crazy?&nbsp; Elsewhere in matters auto-relational, Jim just noticed that all of his romances have been with women who drive Volkswagens; and Derek needs to get his beloved Jeep off the front lawn, before his wife gets him out of the house. Also, a passenger-side farting sound is causing some major embarrassment for Alicia; Paul needs to figure out why his wife&apos;s Hyundai is moaning before she gives birth; and Ben is wondering if a potato can really fill in for a radio antenna. All that and lots more, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, after three crashes, nine vandalizations, and one, "Ah, never mind" theft, Ellen has decided to part ways with her Honda Civic. Does she need to disclose its troubled past to prospective buyers? Elsewhere, Glenn loves his CRX, but his friends are telling him the car is scaring away potential dates. Does he need new wheels, or maybe just a new wardrobe? Also, Greg&apos;s Jetta begins shedding hair; Alicia decides that four years is long enough to ignore a flashing Check Engine light, and, after an unfortunate spider incident causes Gina to ditch her car in Lake Minnetonka, she wants to know if "Totaled" really does mean totaled.

<description>This week on Car Talk, kids give the "Golden Rule" and a few other maxims an innocent (yet funny) twist. Then it&apos;s off to Arizona where Lily&apos;s Taurus is making a noise that she hopes will lead her husband to make another noise-- namely,&nbsp; "Let&apos;s buy you a new Mustang." But all is not well in Mustang-land for Martin--his is emitting blue smoke, so his wallet be emitting a large boat payment. Meanwhile, out in Washington, Amanda&apos;s marriage is only a few days away, but if she and her fiance can&apos;t figure out what to do with their four cars, the divorce not be far behind. Also, a hand-me-down Accord develops a distaste for Reverse; a DIY CV joint replacement turns into a demolition project; and, can a few strategically placed magnets prolong Peter&apos;s engine life? All this and lots more, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, alas poor Yousef. His fiancee called him a sap, after he fell for a recommendation that he use special "high mileage oil" in his Saturn. Will Tom and Ray be any more sympathetic, or will they try to sell him the Brooklyn Bridge? Elsewhere, Maggie&apos;s hand-me-down Buick is shaking while climbing; Nick&apos;s fuel pump is buzzing after the car is turned off; and Jason&apos;s brakes are squealing--when he&apos;s not stepping on them. Also, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray correctly diagnosed Todd&apos;s backfiring LTD, and got his neighbor and girlfriend to start speaking to him again. All this, plus a few classic Bulwer-Lytton Ccontest winners for bad fiction writing, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, David&apos;s Dodge is having trouble starting, unless he turns the key and counts to 10. Can his problems be solved by a Few Brave Electrons and a broom handle? Meanwhile, Barbara is about to leave her accounting job and head off on a six-month road trip, and wants to do it in the least fiscally prudent vehicle possible--a VW Camper Van. Her biggest problem be grabbing one before Tommy does. Also, Rachel in Minnesota had a very bad windshield wiper day--one blade stopped moving, and the other flew off the car; Carly in Oakland has a Civic that&apos;s been been violently shaking for three years, and she&apos;s finally ready to address the problem; and is Kara&apos;s car doomed after she went to her local gas station and filled up-- on water? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Caroline&apos;s ex-boyfriends have labeled her a Clutch Killer. She&apos;s ignored their admonitions because, well, she was driving their cars. But, now she&apos;s got her own car, and first gear&apos;s getting a little jerky. Is she ready to face the music?&nbsp; Meanwhile, family trouble be brewing for Mac out in California. Mac&apos;s brother borrowed his truck, and while driving it, the hood flew open, and caused a few boat payments-worth of damage, for which Mac&apos;s brother didn&apos;t offer to help pay. Elsewhere, Adam&apos;s Maxima&apos;s windows are mysteriously descending overnight, and he can&apos;t blame his girlfriend anymore; Sarah broke up with her mechanic after two bad mistakes but is considering giving him another chance; and on Stump the Chumps we find out if Muriatic acid de-cemented Josh&apos;s Corolla. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, could one honest man de-sleazify the entire used car industry? Probably not, but that won&apos;t stop Tom and Ray from trying to convince Steve that it&apos;d be a good idea to fix or disclose his CRV&apos;s tendency to take on water before trading it in. This week&apos;s other probing auto-behavioral question comes from Dan in New Hampshire: Do people who keep their cars longer, stay married longer? On the technical front, Anna&apos;s Volvo will only start when it&apos;s facing downhill; Michelle&apos;s gas pedal doesn&apos;t like to move first thing in the morning; and, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Raymond in Utah really had a chicken bone stuck in his fan. Finally, how should Sam handle his newly retired Dad, who&apos;s keeping himself busy be destroying Mom&apos;s Beetle? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week&apos;s Car Talk kicks off with one listener&apos;s brilliant (and only sorta wacko) theory: a non-essential repair on an old car creates a parallel universe in which everything else starts to break. Then it&apos;s off to New Mexico, where Nolina has two choices for dealing with a disintegrating head gasket: a $2500 engine re-build, or a $10 can of Bar&apos;s Leaks. Any bets on which side Tom and Ray come down on? Elsewhere, Michael in New Jersey needs to replace his beloved minivan with something that can accommodate his Daniel Pinkwater-ish body and his very picky teenage daughter; Brian&apos;s looking for a way to convince Little League parents to stop parking in his driveway that doesn&apos;t involve slashing tires; and on Stump the Chumps, does Tom manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of a Ray victory? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, good intentions go bad. For starters, Todd decided to buy his girlfriend a 1973 Ford LTD, on the premise it would be safe and easy to work on. Unfortunately, the car&apos;s loud backfire has led to one dead cat, several deceased goldfish, and one very strained relationship. Elsewhere, Kate&apos;s friends decided to surprise her by picking her up in her car. The only problem? They didn&apos;t know how to drive a stick, and burned out her clutch. And out in Montana, Dari&apos;s mechanics were fixing a sensor on her truck when it just happened to fall off the lift, at full height. Also, Peter in Alaska discovers a new Primordial soup on his dipstick; and should Sven realize his life-dream of owning a &apos;62 Mini, even if it&apos;s been sitting on blocks for 25 years and the owner won&apos;t tell him why? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, strange things are happening in the night: Bruce&apos;s tires are going from full to flat while he sleeps; Cynthia is adding Maalox to her engine instead of motor oil; and Jinx&apos;s romantic moonlight drive is interrupted by smoke billowing from the dashboard after he turned off his headlights. Smoke is also an issue for Henry in California. Actually, it be more of an issue for his neighbor, who happened to be standing behind Henry&apos;s car when it made its morning billow from his tailpipe. Elsewhere, Lisa&apos;s Passat is sounding like a bad 1950&apos;s science fiction movie; and Michal can&apos;t understand why her partner becomes turn-signal averse as soon as he gets on the freeway. All this, plus a few subtle signs it be time for a new car, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Cynthia&apos;s 1987 Vanagon is dying, so she needs a new ride for her three Nigerian swimming goats. After all, the goats have to get to their pool parties, right? Another family transport crisis is unfolding in San Diego, where Scott&apos;s wife wants to buy a motorcycle complete with a sidecar, to get around town with their two small kids. Meanwhile, Kat in Seattle is about to learn an expensive lesson about why you shouldn&apos;t speed over speed bumps; and, Lisa&apos;s efforts to save money on a catalytic converter revives the adage, "It&apos;s the stingy person who spends the most." Also, Dan is about to sell the car his son was born in, but wants to keep a memento--the front seat?!! All this, plus a new Puzzler from the Games of Chance series, and lots more, this week on Car Talk</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, a new entry to the Hall of Wacko Auto-Anthropological Research, courtesy of Beth in Oregon. Beth believes that women, and only women, become less attractive after driving for three hours. Can Tom and Ray offer an explanation, or is this one for Paul Murkey, of Car Talk&apos;s Murkey Research team? Elsewhere, Paula&apos;s Bronco seems to be whistling with perfect pitch; Jonathan&apos;s Saturn is laying out a smoke screen worthy of an Army tank; and former Bostonian Tim is finding the driving style in Vermont to be a little too polite. Also, a brilliant wiring job turned Helen&apos;s VW bus into a home. Sadly, it also have made climbing hills an impossible dream. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Chris&apos; 1959 Belvedere has turned into a greenhouse and Fromagerie, courtesy of some poorly placed birdseed, and a kid who though it would be fun to hide four bricks of blue cheese in the vents. Can he kill the plants and smell without also taking himself out? Elsewhere, Jonathan&apos;s wife is blaming his speed-bump strategy for his Civic&apos;s alignment problems. His reaction to Tom and Ray&apos;s analysis? "I&apos;m a dead man."&nbsp; Also, Jeannie&apos;s looking for validation that the guys telling her to use her emergency brake have their heads up their keisters; and Amy wants to give her husband a dope slap for fixing their Maxima&apos;s rack and pinion with nothing but a hammer.

Then it&apos;s off to Somerville, MA, where Rebecca&apos;s got a squeaking clutch, and Tommy&apos;s having a TMI moment from his childhood.

<description>This week on Car Talk, after missing for two months, Jane&apos;s cat showed up at a house seven miles away, and across two major highways. Did Catzilla stow away during Jane&apos;s daily commute? Elsewhere, Sharon&apos;s Explorer is growling, and Gunther thinks a toilet is flushing under his Astrovan&apos;s dashboard. Also, Lori in Arizona threatens to make Male Answer Syndrome obsolete, with two words: "Google it!"; and, more than you ever wanted to know about Senior Prom planning in Yosemite National Park. All this, plus a new Puzzler from the Dates and Nuts series, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, actress Ashley Judd learns one downside of marriage to a professional race-car driver--he insists on driving every time they&apos;re in the car together. You&apos;d think the guy would want a day off, wouldn&apos;t you? Find out if Tom and Ray can keep this auto-marital dispute off the front page of the National Enquirer. Elsewhere, Andy&apos;s steering wheel is making a noise which he&apos;d like to handle with WD-40, but might be better taken care of by singing a chorus of "Chattanooga Choo Choo," and Tom in New Jersey would really like to blame a tow truck driver for his Honda&apos;s computer failure. Finally, Mary Rawson&apos;s friend has offered to fix her brakes for free, and perhaps get a date at the same time. Can she turn him down and still have a car that will stop? All this and lots more, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, we revisit a caller&apos;s unexplained electrifying vehicular event. Was it an atmospheric abnormality? A UFO? Beam &apos;em up, Scotty! Then it&apos;s warp speed to Georgia where Caroline has another curious conundrum: has a car alarm mysteriously installed itself on her Saturn? Elsewhere, Libby is looking for the perfect car to run away in, and Bob is in dire need of marriage advice. Could the turn signal hold the answer to marital bliss? All that, plus a new tantalizing puzzler from our Travel and Leisure series, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Ray reveals perhaps his best wacko consipracy theory of all time--the reolocation of the Alamo, and his own unsuccessful attempts to rectify the situation. This all takes place as Kelly from San Antonio waits to find out if her fiance&apos;s promiscuous use of a plug-in seat massager is responsible for her car&apos;s drop in gas mileage. Elsewhere, Marshall&apos;s Jeep is making a stnge clunking sound, akin to being hit from behind by a Nerfmobile; Debbie&apos;s clutch is whistling a tune laden with hints of boat payments to come; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Eddie in New Hampshire got his truck started. All this, plus a creative, if incredibly insincere wedding inviation, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

Meanwhile, strange things are happening in Waccabuc, New York, where Sally heard a loud electrical charge and saw a flash of bright light while driving under a power line. Also, Brad&apos;s got a Hydrological and Meteorological crisis, with water appearing in his Civic&apos;s spare tire well; Jack&apos;s horn went from sounding like James Early Jones to Pee Wee Herman overnight; and Melissa&apos;s decision to use her Jeep&apos;s heater as a clothes dryer have expensive consequences.

<description>This week on Car Talk, cleanliness is next to impossible for Andrew, due to his Subaru&apos;s weak rear windshield washer spray. Unfortunately for Andrew, the only thing less productive than the spray be Tom and Ray&apos;s explanation of the cause. Elsewhere, Kate discovered a long gray hair sticking out of her Civic, and is worried she have a UFO-- that&apos;s an Unidentified Furry Object-- living in her exhaust; Joyce is wondering why her mellow, meditation-teaching husband turns into a mix of Mario Andretti and Tony Soprano when he gets behind the wheel; and 14-year-old Matthew is about to learn a valuable Magliozzi lesson about the benefits of doing a lousy job cleaning his parents&apos; car.

<description>This week on Car Talk, DIY filmmaker Seth is preparing to shoot a big scene: a car explosion in the front yard (of his neighbor&apos;s house, of course). Seth&apos;s hoping Tom and Ray can help minimize the risk of seeing his house go up in smithereens, and his eyebrows getting that old familiar "Acme Dynamite" look. Can our Chief Counsel Hugh Louis Dewey duct tape the guys&apos; mouths before they wade in to litigious waters? Elsewhere, Michael&apos;s RAV 4 is whining in the cold weather even louder than Tommy usually does; Ray trips the Bogosity alarm by introducing the "Connecting Rod Stretch Theory" to explain an Explorer&apos;s knocking sound; and on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray diagnose the "amorous donkey" noise in Joan&apos;s Honda? All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, after 18 years in Homer, Alaska, Carla is ready to return to civilization. Her truck? Not so much. It can only climb hills in Reverse. Find out if Tom and Ray can stop laughing long enough to help Carla and her truck move forward. Elsewhere, Elizabeth&apos;s truck hasn&apos;t started for such a long time, her neighbors decorated it with Christmas lights. And the last time her mate tried to start it, he lit it on fire, so the long-term prognosis here not be good.&nbsp; Also, Kathy&apos;s Stratus smells of burnt popcorn; Matt&apos;s Vanagon is leaking coolant from all four corners of the head gasket; and Wilbur hears his Dad scolding him from hundreds of miles away every time he tries to get frost off his windshield. All this plus an MG trick we urge you not to try at home, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Steve&apos;s cross-country road trip got a little more exciting when high winds began blowing open the driver&apos;s door on his Pathfinder. He&apos;s wondering if this is just a design quirk to make the car feel more outdoors-y, or if there&apos;s an actual problem--and can said problem be fixed with anything other than duct tape or rope? Elsewhere, Patricia loves her Rambler-- except for the calling card of black soot it leaves in every parking space; Jamie&apos;s suffering an epidemic of escaping spark plugs; and, after a "low smoke" at-home alternator replacement, Helen&apos;s oil light is flashing a little too much for comfort.

<description>This week on Car Talk, Josh let a boa constrictor get loose in his wife&apos;s Fusion. In the ensuing snake hunt, he removed just about every bit of the car&apos;s interior. Now, after putting it all back together, he&apos;s got a few pieces left over. Will a few missing parts make such a big difference? Elsewhere, Larry&apos;s got a minor problem with a sticky throttle, but be in more trouble over his choice of an engagement ring; and, Deb&apos;s so worried about her Camry&apos;s jingling sound that she&apos;s waited a full year to tell anyone about it. Also, Molly&apos;s having a tough time teaching her daughter to drive after a garage mishap, but is Molly&apos;s daughter the problem or is Molly? And, it&apos;s a happy day for Tommy: The venerable Dodge Dart is back! All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, life in the Big Easy is proving to be anything but that for Betsy and her truck. Since relocating to New Orleans, her Toyota has taken to spewing gas all over the place. Her mechanic&apos;s first guess? Mud chiggers in the fuel line! Entomology also comes into play later on, as Ray uses an ant colony to help explain why Nancy&apos;s Nissan won&apos;t start in cold weather unless she turns the heater on first. Also, Rob has to replace a Camry door that won&apos;t open; Susanne&apos;s DIY thermostat repair created a host of other problems, without fixing the one she was trying to address; and Daniel and his wife are struggling over the question, "Whose arm rest is this?"

<description>This week on Car Talk, Hans recalls fleeing from Germany during World War II in a car powered by woodchips, but he&apos;s never been able to figure out exactly how it worked. So who better than two car experts with MIT degrees to figure this out? Well, maybe anyone would be better in this case. Tom and Ray will likely do better helping David figure out how a three-pound bag of Hershey Kisses disappeared from his Civic overnight, and why his car now smells of melted chocolate. Elsewhere, Victoria&apos;s Mom needs to trade in her Corvette after surgery, so Victoria&apos;s wondering what car&apos;s right for a hip Mom with a new hip; Aaron&apos;s windshield wipers are stuck in a salute position; and, is Mary-Ellen wearing out her brakes parking in "The Gulch" every day? A box of doughnuts is riding on the answer, so this is serious business. All this and lots more, this week, on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, does a dorsal fin make a car less aerodynamic? That&apos;s Dan&apos;s question, after he decided his Tercel was lacking that important fishy feature. So, he sculpted one for the hood. Is such a problem even possible for a Tercel? Elsewhere, Mary&apos;s been driving her Mustang around with a trunk full of compost. Her husband says it&apos;s time to clean it out, but Mary thinks the ballast is worth a few mold spores. Also, Vanessa&apos;s Sunbird&apos;s making a classic rattle, Eddie&apos;s F-150 won&apos;t start, Megan&apos;s looking to get a new car and a new guy; and Stephan&apos;s about to learn there&apos;s a fine line between Genius and Wacko--and me have just crossed it. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Santa comes through big-time for Tom and Ray in their never ending quest to escape difficult callers. They&apos;re now the proud owners of the Get Off the Phone Excuse Machine, and it&apos;s likely to get an early test, thanks to Nancy and the Tupperware-like noise cooing from her Volvo. Elsewhere, desperate times call for wacko measures, as Jamie considers plugging a cracked head with oatmeal, Mark ponders giving his Suburban a full drive-train transplant into a new body, and Julie goes shopping for any car that can survive her husband&apos;s aversion to the emergency brake. And, Jan "The Waver" responds to her husband&apos;s concerns about her overly friendly driving style. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Susan leads a double life--Philosophy Professor by day, and animal rescuer by night. Unfortunately, she&apos;s come to realize her beloved Honda Civic can&apos;t handle the olfactory implications of her full range of clientele. Can Tom and Ray help her find the perfect Pig and Prof-mobile? Elsewhere, Jim&apos;s having dipstick removal issues; Dave&apos;s wife&apos;s friendliness is scaring the dickens out of him; and Samantha and her husband are having a raging debate over… how best to hang dry cleaning in a car?&nbsp; Really? And, on Stump the Chumps, we find out if the second carburetor was the charm for Chelsea. All this, plus an explosive tale from Ray&apos;s high school days, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Molly&apos;s boyfriend gets irate when other drivers fail to use their turn signals. But when Molly caught him committing his own blinker transgression, said boyfriend had a ready explanation, that send the bogosity meter way into the red. Elsewhere, Terry in New Mexico has a long history of breaking in new cars and wives, both of which are being tested by his new Rav 4; Peter in Brooklyn&apos;s good deed went bad, after several gallons of post-Thanksgiving turkey oil spilled in the back of his Passat; and Jill in Wyoming is wondering why the local horses find her Jeep&apos;s hood so tasty.

<description>This week, Car Talk kicks off with a few new words that be coming to a dictionary near you. Then, they put one of those words right to work, with a series of brilliant stupiphanies: Jim in Florida learns why his next boat trip leave him stranded in international waters; Liz in Missouri discovers that Porsche ownership comes with a monthly dose of sticker shock; and Jean finds out why her car have violated just about every one of Newton&apos;s laws. Also, Rich needs help choosing the perfect $100 Demolition Derby car; and Will has a serious interior decorating concern: how do you mount a dashboard hula dancer so it doesn&apos;t become a projectile if the airbag deploys? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, is back-seat driving genetic? Apparently so for Liz in Massachusetts, who&apos;s picked up the nagging habit from her Mom. Making matters worse, Liz&apos;s husband&apos;s poor navigation skills make him a prime target. Can Tom and Ray break this cycle of rolled eyes and loud sighs? Elsewhere, Jay did a little backyard maintenance on his Honda and saw his gas mileage drop by 30 percent; Ivan&apos;s suffering from an epidemic of flat tires, accompanied by odd circular abrasions; and Alexandria&apos;s car doesn&apos;t like starting on warm days. Also, why Tommy is #1 on the Must Bite list among the dogs of Unadillia, New York. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Patrick in Alaska loves his Prius&apos; gas mileage, but thinks the car could look cooler--say, if its engine was in the body of a Model A Ford. Is it a worthwhile project, or one destined for the Hall of Fame of Bad Ideas? Meanwhile, Nicole is wondering why her Dad&apos;s balking at her plan to take a road trip in a 2009 Subaru--especially since the old man recently drove across&nbsp; the country in a &apos;37 Chevy. Elsewhere, Diana&apos;s looking for a car with just a few requirements: safety, reliability, good gas mileage, room for her to sleep, crappy looks, a microwave oven-- okay, strike that last item. Also, a braking strategy that&apos;s guaranteed to make nobody ride with you; a few really bad car slogans; and a new Puzzler from the African Rainforest series.

<description>This week on Car Talk, science fiction comes to Keller, Texas, as Isuzus cease functioning when they come close to a mysterious FAA "weather device." Is GORT up to his old tricks, or is the answer a bit more down to earth? Elsewhere, Kathleen and her husband escaped a scary rollover in their Subaru. But, what&apos;s truly frightening is that Kathleen&apos;s husband is still intent on driving it. Also, a Land Rover needs either a new transmission or two in the hat; a clutch job goes bad in New Jersey; and, a husband turns to science to explain why his wife shouldn&apos;t listen to Car Talk.

<description>This week on Car Talk, could anything possibly go wrong when you take a cross-country road trip with your beloved fiance and dear old mom? Well, meet Charity-- and let&apos;s just say that car trouble was the least of her problems! Then, it&apos;s off to Oregon, where Jackie is wondering if her bra can withstand the car wash. (Shrinkage, anyone?!) Meanwhile, Tami&apos;s neighbors are wondering if her Buick has gas... and we&apos;re not talking 93 octane, if you catch our drift. And in Minnesota, Peter wants to know how to lure a hamster out of his wife&apos;s Acura. Four-course meal, anyone? All that, plus a new puzzler from Ray&apos;s Ceiling Lights Series, on this week&apos;s electrifying hour of Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Tac and her siblings are looking for a way to keep their dearly departed Dad&apos;s car in their memories, but out of their wallets. So before they bid farewell to his Camry, she&apos;s wondering what parts work best as keepsakes. Maybe a tire to hang on the wall? Elsewhere, Anne is longing to buy a vintage MG convertible, but her husband&apos;s insisting it come with one accessory--an English mechanic in the trunk. Also, our resident Chemist Jim Davis follows up on the hazards of urine in a radiator; the Men of Maple Corner try to keep their parade car from bursting into flames; and can Chris&apos; carburetor problems be solved by a run through the dishwasher? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, does a car have a soul? That&apos;s the auto-philosophical conundrum underpinning the engine transplant Jeff&apos;s Isuzu needs. And if a car does have a soul... where does it live, anyway? In the engine, the gas tank... or maybe the fuzzy dice? Meanwhile, Andy&apos;s Jeep overheated in the desert, and since he had no water, he used the only fluid he had on him to top off the radiator. Yep, that one. Which leads to his question for our hosts: just what are the corrosive effects of a pint of urine?&nbsp; Elsewhere, Mary&apos;s Camry is quacking, Diane&apos;s Thunderbird is fish-tailing, and Helena and her husband just picked up a &apos;66 Rambler that&apos;s perfect-- except for the fact it can only go in reverse. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Stephen is riding high--unwittingly so. He got new engine mounts in his Mercury, and now the car reeks of marijuana. Did his mechanic leave a little bag under hood? Elsewhere, 11-year-old Hannah&apos;s Dad is having a jolly good time blowing his car horn at her. Is she seeking mechanical advice from Tom and Ray on, say, how to disconnect the horn? No, she wants a prank to get even with dear old Dad. Also, our Physicist on call weighs in on the great bird poop- cracked windshield debate; Ray reveals his love for Fiat&apos;s new arrival on our shores; and proof that listening to Car Talk is great training for a career... in Interior decorating. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Joe&apos;s brother-in-law collects heaps. Unfortunately he deposits them in other people&apos;s yards-- like Joe&apos;s, for instance. Now Joe&apos;s got an &apos;83 Civic sprouting weeds out of the headliner. Can Tom and Ray help Joe cure a bad case of Latent Junkman Syndrome? Meanwhile, Kristy&apos;s husband has developed a warm relationship with their mechanic, which is all well and good, except that said mechanic has charged them $600, and their Stanza still won&apos;t start. Also, a bad day gets worse for Matt in L.A., when his Volvo falls off a tow truck, and his insurance company tries to convince him it&apos;s actually not totaled. And, is the Supreme Court using Car Talk methodology? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week, we proudly introduce a sure-fire cure for Car Talk-induced narcolepsy. Did we make the show more engaging and compelling? Sorry, we&apos;re not miracle workers.&nbsp; Meanwhile, in matters automotive, Mike is baffled by his Chevy&apos;s ability to suck a shirt in through it&apos;s exhaust, and even more baffled by Tom and Ray&apos;s attempts to explain it. Also, Tamara&apos;s wondering if it&apos;s time to bid farewell to her beloved Vanagon for something a bit less barbaric; Marc wants to know if late night TV really can improve his gas mileage;&nbsp; and on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray correctly diagnose Becka&apos;s cough and sputter?

Elsewhere, Lancelot just got home from Burning Man with a souvenir he didn&apos;t ask for-- the alkali salt dust now in every pore of his Pathfinder.

<description>This week on Car Talk, the Big Book of Bad Ideas gets a new chapter. Ted wants to work on his 1947 Jeep by tipping it on its side-- yes, on its side--and relying on his three brothers to hold it place. Can Tom and Ray move Ted towards a less life-threatening approach? Meanwhile, Lynn in Colorado is concerned about her new Subaru&apos;s key heating feature; Russell in North Carolina is being serenaded by George Gershwin every time he turns on his air conditioning; and is "sometimes they just need a good kick in the pants" really the right answer to Steve&apos;s transmission mystery? Finally, a shout out to any bird poop terminal velocity experts in the audience--Tom and Ray could use your help! All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

Can Tom and Ray help him get his car back? Or, can they at least stop laughing at him? Meanwhile, chemistry class is in session for John in Ohio, and today&apos;s lesson involves his van&apos;s radiator, and a certain co-host&apos;s dubious "hungry water theory". Elsewhere, Julia is worried that her Dad&apos;s obsession with putting a new engine in his Suburban be causing marital strife; Carla&apos;s Accord is making a screech that&apos;s scaring her entire neighborhood; and Ariel wants to know how to prepare herself for her first trip to a new car dealer--maybe start with a suit of armor? All this, plus proof that Car Talk can aid physical fitness, and lots more,this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dickie in Louisiana gets a big surprise when he takes the steering wheel off his girlfriend&apos;s Lexus-- and water comes gushing out the steering column. Dickie&apos;s hydraulic confrontation leads us to Car Talk mystery #1: Is it coming from above or below? (We&apos;re not talking about the water, we&apos;re talking about from which part of Ray&apos;s anatomy he&apos;s grabbing the answer.) Mystery #2 this week comes from the Northwest, where Bob is wondering just how much damage a sock can do when it gets sucked into the engine manifold. Also, Volvo introduces the remote dope slap, the Puzzler&apos;s work ethic is questioned, and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if a truck can be overpriced-- at $170.&nbsp; All that and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, a million dollar idea from one of our listeners: an NPR-themed restaurant. The only problem is, the menu is a bit limited--to two items. In matters automotive, Renee in New York got two nasty surprises recently. Her Acura wouldn&apos;t start, and when she opened the hood, she was greeted by the leftovers from an engine picnic, including chicken bones, coldcuts, and a bag of Doritos. Meanwhile, Fran&apos;s got a brilliant idea for changing his oil and killing his engine at the same time, and Foreign Service Officer Joan is wondering how many trunks of spare car parts she needs to bring to her next assignment in Madagascar. Also, how to get revenge on a soon to be ex-husband who&apos;s planted a GPS unit in your car. All this, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>We&apos;re all getting older, so as a public service, this week on Car Talk we update a few classic songs to reflect our demographic shift. For example, "I get by with a little help from Depends." In matters automotive, Mickey&apos;s Nissan sounds like it&apos;s getting a wedgie whenever he turns on the AC, and a recent fender bender has Stephanie worried about passing an upcoming smog test. Also, Lisa&apos;s looking for help trying to convince her husband to rent&nbsp; an RV for a road trip to Graceland, and Doctor Rich&apos;s new cigar habit&apos;s given him both a stinky car-- and a nasty cough. And, what bad advice could leave Sally with a tombstone reading "She died getting 95 miles per gallon"? All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week&apos;s Car Talk kicks off with a cautionary tale of what not to say the first time your girlfriend tells you she loves you. Elsewhere in Relationship Land, Jackie&apos;s racking up huge chiropractor bills thanks to her boyfriend&apos;s starting method, and Lori&apos;s trying to learn how to drive the ancient trucks her boyfriend&apos;s taken to collecting. Also, a good dope slap gets an alternator to behave; shop rags become uninvited and unwelcome guests in Joel&apos;s transmission; and a wonderful evening of hood dancing takes its toll on a $200 Chevy Nova. All this, plus a used car ad sets a new high for truth in advertising, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, are you ready for some wacko theories? Dennis in California puts Tom and Ray to the test, pondering his friend&apos;s contention that the best way to charge a dead car battery is by turning on every accessory in sight. Is there anything to this notion of "tickling the electrons"? Elsewhere in Wackyland, Jenny is convinced that her Civic has a harder time starting when its gas tank&apos;s not full; Linda needs to retro-fit her ATV to make it a good Summer sled-dog training vehicle; and mechanic-turned-sculptor Coby learns what happens when you add a few extra tons to a half-ton pickup. All this, plus some choice Last Words, and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Scott in Alaska is searching for a way to keep his windshield clean, and the local salmon population happy. You&apos;d think a couple of MIT grads would know the perfect eco-friendly, wiper fluid solution, right? Well, maybe not so much. Meanwhile, Gregory&apos;s Chevy has a nasty habit of stalling when he parks facing uphill--which wouldn&apos;t be a big deal, except for the fact that he lives in San Francisco. Also, Cynthia&apos;s convinced that clean oil is improving her Acura&apos;s gas mileage, and has 100 bucks riding on Tom and Ray agreeing with her; Andy&apos;s got a pesky Check Engine light that&apos;s ignoring his best efforts to ignore it--and, why you never want to go to a movie with Ray. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Ray&apos;s quest for more "usable" sunshine leads him to a proposal both brilliant and wacko: Double-Dog Daylight Savings, probably not coming to a time zone near you. Then, Davis&apos; squeaky Durango sparks another novel idea: if you don&apos;t know where a squeak is coming from, just dip the whole car in silicone spray. Elsewhere, Sarah&apos;s got an exploding rear windshield, Ben can&apos;t shift his Accord into Park, and Natalie&apos;s trying to convince her husband that spending lunch hour in his car listening to sports talk radio is a bad idea. Finally, Chris is looking for a suitable prank to get back at the guys who left a dead fish in his truck. Fortunately for Chris, our hosts might just have a few ideas. All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, what happens when you a tell a woman her Sable is a Granny car? If you&apos;re Mac&apos;s wife, you co-opt his pickup truck and drive that instead! Now Mac is hoping Tom and Ray can help liberate his beloved Tacoma from her clutches. Elsewhere on the marital front, Amanda&apos;s all hot and bothered over her husband&apos;s refusal to turn on the air conditioning. Also, why Danielle&apos;s stuck windshield wipers are helping keep her car clean; a side-view mirror masher tries to blame the victim; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Jackson&apos;s bad idea for moving a chicken coop came home to roost. All this, plus the Puzzler Finale from the Prisoners in Hats series, this week on Car Talk.</description>

<description>This week on Car Talk, Ryan went for an oil change, and got talked into an "engine shampoo" (no creme rinse, please)! Now, he&apos;s become a walking punchline among his friends, and he&apos;s wondering if his engine isn&apos;t the only thing that got taken to the cleaners. Elsewhere, Marina loves her Jeep, but after 250,000 miles, is it finally time to deep six it in Lake Erie? Alicia needs help fixing her Saab without having to go on a second date with her mechanic; and did the Car Talk podcast really help save a marriage?

<description>This week on Car Talk, Dad gets equal time. Topher, whose daughter Rebecca rebelled against his strict record-keeping, checks in to explain the origins of his now-infamous little maintenance book, and whether Rebecca really is off the family payroll. Another follow-up comes from Car Talk&apos;s on-call chemist, Jim Davis, who&apos;s been in the lab trying to get Sprite to char a leather car seat. In new business, Cameron&apos;s got a starter that&apos;s been screeching for 8 months; Bill in Maine is hoping to get one working Probe out of the three in his driveway; and Episcopal priest Jep is wondering if he needs to grant absolution to the mechanic who have messed up his timing belt job.

His plan involves a Toyota Tacoma, a snowmobile trailer-- and one ginormous coop of unknown poundage. Are his fears of a catastrophic collapse justified? Will the chickens have to get out and push? Elsewhere, Chantel in California has decided to come clean about an incident that have croaked Dad&apos;s Volvo a decade back. Can Tom and Ray can keep her in Dad&apos;s will? Also, a Prius turns into a gas geyser, a VW owner learns about the high cost of driving through a deep puddle, and, is Tommy&apos;s addition to the Miata universe enough to strip it of "chick car" status?

They interrupt for a few moments to tell Colleen why her truck is melting air filters. Meanwhile, Dan in Oregon find his faith tested by a coolant leak; John treated his Excort to a new clutch and got a new noise from it in return; and Jennifer needs help escaping her husband&apos;s new BFF&apos;s--the Miata Owners Club.</description>

<description>Gender equity comes to Car Talk Plaza this week, as male and female callers are both advised to respond to spousal auto-critiques with a polite, but firm, "Shut up, Hon." Elsewhere, Stuart&apos;s Camry is making a scary metallic quacking sound; Bill is wondering if Radiator Stop Leak will work on his wooden hot tub; and Liz the Librarian is about to learn why she shouldn&apos;t make jack-rabbit starts. And, for Mother&apos;s Day, one Mom&apos;s tale of a teenager to be greatly admired--and feared.</description>

<description>Another voice rises in defense of the much-maligned Yugo. After all, how many cars can you garage in your living room? Also, a Lexus develops a very sweet, and expensive smell, while Eau de Skunk has taken up permanent residence in a BMW. And, bad fatherly advice leads to a very chilly Winter in Maryland. All this, plus Stump the Chumps, and lots more.</description>

<description>Leanne in Connecticut dreams of fashioning her own mini-snowplow for her Subaru. Her husband thinks she&apos;s nuts, but Tom and Ray think she could be the next late-night infomercial superstar. Also, a Toyota comes home from the Philippines with a bang; a new alternator puts a spark in a marriage; and Tommy drives to the Dark Side.</description>

<description>Ray tries to erase a recent Puzzler from the collective consciousness. Then, he and his his brother try to stimulate the economy by encouraging Shawn to buy a new car for his one-woman demolition derby wife, and Martha, who&apos;s a couple hundred dollars away from being able to take her key out of the ignition. And, a Sentra falls victim to sibling rivalry.</description>

<description>A family road trip in a Winnebago lands them on Smoky Bear&apos;s Most Wanted list, in the latest from our series of auto-confessionals. Also, a quick lesson in the giving of dope slaps; the truth about 8th Grade (at least, Tom and ray&apos;s version of it); and what do you tell prospective parents who&apos;d rather drive a horse and buggy than a mini-van? "Saddle up!"</description>

<description>It&apos;s the Candy Bar Wrapper Rebellion, as one Magliozzi frees herself from the shackles of a neat car. Also, a re-located airline pilot considers settling down in a VW Westphalia, with the mailing address "Employee Parking Lot"; on Stump the Chumps we find out if Scott got his Nissan to start, and survived Fat Tony and his big bucket o&apos; tools; and if your Dad&apos;s a mechanic, but won&apos;t fix your heater, does it mean he doesn&apos;t love you?</description>

Other areas of concern: Sandra fears for her engine&apos;s life after accidentally using diesel fuel, while Natalie fears for her own life after denting Dad&apos;s car while he&apos;s away. Also, to tip or not to tip, at the pump?</description>

She wants to know how to take care of her truck while she&apos;s gone, but Tom and Ray are more interested in how she plans to pedal across several large bodies of water. Also, an opera singer begins doing arias under a Honda Civic; a vintage T-Bird puts its owner to sleep; and meet the car that strikes fear into mechanics near and far.</description>

<description>We kick off with a few auto-confessionals, including a case study in how not to deliver bad news to a customer. Also, a stuck rotor leads to fire and a bump on the forehead for Dave in Pennsylvania; Sarah in Illinois wants to use her Saturn to haul her worldly belongings to Arizona; and how do you tell your father in law, "Thanks, but I really don&apos;t want that Bricklin"?</description>

<description>Here&apos;s a new complaint: "My car is getting too miles per gallon". This week, Ephraim ponders his Audi&apos;s new thriftiness, and wonders if it&apos;s just trying to congratulate him on his engagement. Also, holiday family gatherings mean family arguments. Specifically, is it possible to park in a way that makes it impossible to get out the way you went in; and, will a wreath on the hood cook an engine? And, if a Brigadier General wants to drive 140 mph, who are we to stop him?</description>

<description>A bad case of auto-marital guilt has Alethea in Texas reaching for her hot glue gun to keep her husband&apos;s hubcaps on. Also, Amy&apos;s husband refers to his &apos;92 Pathfinder as "the Giving Tree." She calls it a piece of junk. Will Tom and Ray give her the ammunition to send it to the crusher? And, do 300,000 miles and bald tires equal a good divorce settlement?</description>

<description>A gecko hitches a ride, and takes up residence in a Lexus. Also, two lessons in what not to do with a borrowed car: get it stuck in 4-Wheel drive and drop a pen cap into the gas tank; Plus, a Kia experiences symptoms of eating too many burritos; the Puzzler returns from Summer vacation; and, is being right worth having a stinky, sweaty boyfriend?</description>

<description>Vern from Ohio wonders if he really destroyed his wife&apos;s sister&apos;s husband&apos;s minivan, and, whether it matters, since he&apos;s not related to the guy? Also, a close call at Car Talk Plaza reaffirms the value of goofing off; an expectant Mini owner worries about past encounters with shifters; and some ways for Tommy to get out of trouble next time he likens his wife to a truck.</description>

<description>Childhood writings by our Technical Advisor John Bugsy Lawlor offer a glimpse of the man he&apos;d become, and give our hosts the chance to laugh--a lot. Also, is wanting to start your car without whacking the fuel pump asking too much? Or, wanting your door to close without the use of rope? And, a Creative Writing class exercise shows a very deep failure to communicate.</description>

<description>Ray offers a mea culpa on a recent Puzzler, with a little technical help from Tommy. Then it&apos;s off to New Mexico, where Ramey&apos;s got crickets under the hood, and to South Dakota, where David&apos;s got birds leaving calling card on his truck. Also, how do you tell a know-it-all friend she&apos;s rife with bogosity, and why one truck might ride better with a piano on its roof.</description>

<description>A Car Talk-style salute to the late Puzzler Master Martin Gardner. Meanwhile, a leaky moon roof becomes a good test of a relationship, as does a Chevy Malibu&apos;s passenger seat relocated to the dining room table. Also, the horrible truth about a blast of body odor that only occurs on left turns, and a valuable lesson--before you drive your car from North Carolina to Alaska, learn how to drive it!</description>

<description>Do twin brothers working in the same garage have the same auto-diagnostic skills? As one unfortunate caller learns, probably not. Also, is a $10,000 Camaro repair worth doing, if it means also budgeting for a divorce? And, a prank is delivered via Post-It, and on Stump the chumps, was mild mannered Teresa really being trailed by Black Op helicopters?</description>

Also, is knitting near an airbag a good idea, how to get in trouble with your mother in law in one easy step, can a non-English speaking tennis pro change the timing belt on a Volvo, and does a mid-life crisis car lose its curative pawers if you worry about its roof?</description>

<description>Tom poses the question listeners have been asking for decades--"What are we doing here, anyway?" Happily, Ray is on hand to provide an answer. Also, what do a blower motor in Utah and a spark plug in Connecticut have in common? They both be making unexpected appearances. And, can an odometer really be off by a factor of 10, or does Ruth in Virginia need to have a loooonggg talk with her teenage son.</description>

<description>We prepare for baseball season with a few choice quotes from Yogi Berra. Then, we prepare two callers for visits with their loan officers, or the local junkyard. Also, one woman tries to decide which bit of Car Talk wisdom is less lousy, a simple oil change turns into the Worst Day Ever, and is a Honda Civic trying to discourage its owner from moving it from Santa Barbara, CA to Our Fair State?</description>

<description>Teresa in Yakima, WA needs help drying her hair during her morning commute. Also, for Adam in Oregon, the price for ignoring a balky transmission and blinking Check Engine light is a few thousand dollars, and ridicule in front of a national audience. Also, Stratus owner Ravi&apos;s love is tested by a pending engine rebuild, and Jane in Alabama&apos;s not crying over spilled milk, but she is pretty bummed about spilled crem in her husband&apos;s BMW.</description>

<description>Ed in PA needs help choosing an engine for the airplane he&apos;s building in his garage. Do Tom and Ray have enough liability insurance to give him an answer? Also, guilt-racked Cindy worries that she killed her engine driving in a post-carbon monoxide poisoning haze, Sarah in Boston would like her car to be less hospitable to thieves, and less of a target for delivery trucks, and is a trip to the Giggle Hut as healthy as a trip to the gym?</description>

<description>How to choose between two mid-life crisis heaps, and keep your wife from knowing about it. Also, an English teacher&apos;s plan to treat his students to a recreation of "On the Road" prompts Ray to recall dear old Uncle Dodo; black tape over a Check Engine light fails to solve a fuel problem; a team of janitors take up shop under the floor of a Grand Cherokee; and an offer too good for Tommy to refuse?</description>

Also, door locks that don&apos;t know when to quit, and a Puzzler from the chicken soup department.</description>

Also, a "bogging out" Accord bums out Dad&apos;s wallet, a Physics Professor lives on the edge of timing belt disaster, a truck won&apos;t stop starting, and on Stump the Chumps, the Good Neighbor policy gets a big test.</description>

Also, a Jeep makes what is most likely the most embarrassing car noise possible, a Chevy owner needs to run red lights to avoid cold air, a couple gets into a heated debate over warming up cars, and how a toothbrush helped start a Mercedes.</description>

Also, a pregnancy induced impulse buy turns into a very large and unreliable gas guzzler the one family member can&apos;t even fit in.

<description>This week on Car Talk, a few choice lines from Rodney Dangerfield set the stage for Sam in Vermont, who&apos;s about to learn he has a cracked block--and his car isn&apos;t doing so hot, either. Also, a married Dad&apos;s need for speed hits a bump in the form of his wife, and Tom and Ray; a Yukon owner tries to convince her Dad and her mechanic that her car really is making a strange noise; and a cardinal becomes overly fond of a Side-view mirror.</description>

<description>What do a tire pressure gauge, a football helmet and a spaceman suit have in common? They&apos;re all suggestions from Tom and Ray to help a caller get over his fear of inflating tires. Meanwhile, another caller wonders if jumper cables are overrated after watching a battery-to-battery jumpstart. Also, a Corolla that won&apos;t quit--even when its owner wants it to, and a biathlete searches for the perfect $400 car.</description>

<description>After three years of parking only in circular driveways, Steve in Florida decides it&apos;s time to address (cheaply) the absence of Reverse in his &apos;97 Jetta. Also, a Dad&apos;s promise to his soccer star daughter has Mom in a tizzy, a Highlander owner tries to free her stuck-open sunroof from volcanic ash before she has to measure snowfall in the backseat with a meter stick, and lots more.</description>

<description>A few songs you likely won&apos;t hear this Hanukkah. Also, the morning commute in Louisville gets a lot more interesting, thanks to Bill&apos;s loss of brakes; a roll of quarters stages a mass escape into the floor of an Avalon, and why one Jeep owner is especially wary of potholes.</description>

<description>Three years after looking for a car for a cross-country road trip, Libbie from Seattle checks in on Stump the Chumps. Did she take Tom and Ray&apos;s advice? Was Ray&apos;s prophecy that she&apos;d never return to Seattle come true? Also, a gym teacher gets a chance to set a good example for his students, a CRV turns into a Catmobile, and what&apos;s considered "high mileage" on a used car?</description>

<description>Meet Tom and Ray&apos;s new pal, Sal. He&apos;s got a Chevy with a problem that can be solved with 1200 dollars, or an early morning call from nature. But it&apos;s his voice that truly catches our hosts&apos; fancy. Also, is Grandpa&apos;s &apos;72 Dodge worth resuscitating, or should Quentin just take the hat off the dashboard and call it a day? And, if you were searching for an elk-proof car, would a Mini spring to mind?</description>

<description>Bad news comes in three&apos;s for two callers: Rick, who&apos;s had three differentials burst into flames while driving, and Jonathan, who&apos;s seen three sparkplugs jump out of his engine. Also, is an open invitation to a car thief the best deterrent, a road-trip turns into a real blowout, and Ray delivers a mea culpa on the now infamous football Puzzler.</description>

<description>How big a focus group do you need to consign a car to Dorksville? Is the fact that Mom drives one all the evidence you need? Also, will a facelift rekindle a Volvo owner&apos;s passion, is a Summer in Palm Springs hot enough to melt tires, and on Stump the Chumps, was Champagne&apos;s rattle really caused by a loose heat shield?</description>

Also, on Stump the Chumps, did Tom and Ray successfully solve Simon&apos;s wibbly-wobblies, a Saab turns into a sullen teenager, a Dad wonders if there&apos;s a "Hey guys, watch this" gene, and a few things you never heard your mother say.</description>

<description>Paging Alfred Hitchcock! A flock of turkeys has gone on the attack against--a Toyota Prius! This week on Car Talk, Tom and Ray try to figure out what&apos;s attracting the birds, and what the owner can do to discourage them? Also, three separate car owners with one goal: an encounter with a UPS truck; how to explode a muffler in one easy step; and, on Stump the Chumps, the return of Nunzio the Knucklescraper.</description>

<description>What&apos;s the proper way to thank a mechanic for fixing a problem in 12 seconds, and charging 25 bucks? Also, should a guy who just drove across a stream be more afraid of car damage, or his wife? And, a case of distracted braking leads to cries of "Booooogusss!" All this, some excruciating puns and more, on this week&apos;s encore edition.</description>

Meanwhile, a GMC Safari owner searches for the perfect gunk to avoid a transmission rebuild, a whooping Taurus becomes a good relationship tester, and would you trade a pair of busted skis for a 10-year old Jetta that won&apos;t shift?</description>

<description>Two separate incidents: A bowling sized boulder in Death Valley and a stuck ignition key, elicit the same reaction--a 2-word phase beginning with, "Oh", and ending with a word we can&apos;t print here. Also, is 15,000 miles too long between oil changes, even if the car company&apos;s paying for it, one teenager gets advice guaranteed to get his parents (and their lawyer) on the phone, and St. Elmo&apos;s fire appears on a DC street?</description>

Also, a Sebring begins to channel a VW diesel, a Mercedes owner can only laugh at the prospect of a 2,000 dollar brake job, and could a series of problems plaguing a Camry have been avoided by naming the car?</description>

<description>Is the price of a new power steering pump worth not having to admit your wife and her ex-boyfriend are right? Also, hungry squirrels choose an unlikely Corolla part as a snack, a caller returns for more buying advice 22 years later, and some thoughts from noted maritotologists Henny Youngman, Rodney Dangerfield, and Rita Rudner.</description>

<description>On Stump the Chumps, we find out whether Bill and his Subaru survived Mount Redoubt&apos;s eruptions. Also, a spoon prank goes awry in a Grand Am, another reason why you shouldn&apos;t trust a mechanic with hairy knuckles, and could a dealer really use feed corn to conceal a failing muffler?</description>

<description>A hair-singeing tale that goes beyond Tommy dropping a lit cigarette in his lap. Also, the solution to a stuck key is--yoga? Plus, why the movie classic "Gaslight" be to blame for poor tire pressure, and on Stump the Chumps, one caller plus two problems equals a sweep, a split, or a double drubbing?</description>

<description>Title: Everything I Don&apos;t Know About Cars, I Learned from Car Talk For all you budding mechanics, a case study in why not to choose Tom and Ray as your mentors. Also, a Toyota owner worries her minivan&apos;s tailgate is trying to kill her, why a furniture trip ends with zero couches and two new tires, and we meet Brooklyn gas station attendants&apos; Public Enemy Number 1.</description>

Also, does a Rabbit diesel need an extra pair of Bronco Nagurskis, did Steve find the missing battery in his Escort, and, what&apos;s a mechanic to do when the car he&apos;s working on falls off the lift? Find out Ray&apos;s response, and lots more.</description>

<description>A warm blanket can work wonders, but can it really take credit for starting a Subaru? Also, a game of Hide and Seek with a Ford Escort battery, does motor oil separate a la Paul Newman salad dressing, does a missing tailpipe count as a "necessary repair", and Ray&apos;s "near-hernia" experience becomes Puzzler fodder.</description>

<description>A few choice words from Groucho Marx. Also, a caller has more fun on Car Talk than we ever thought possible, can bad homemade wine be re-purposed as wiper fluid, and one man&apos;s electric car dream is his wife&apos;s nightmare. Also, the Puzzler commemorates the Presidential inauguration, Stump the Chumps, and lots more.</description>

<description>Is Detroit desperate enough to take marketing advice from Tom and Ray? If so, the guys have a few ideas to help "move the metal". Also, a 35-minute Windy City warmup, a round of "ABS roulette", and a problem that&apos;s too serious for black tape... so bring on the spray paint! And, a new Puzzler from the Dark and Stormy Night series.</description>

<description>Winter draws closer, and the good folks of Tofte, Minnesota are in a dispute over how best to orient a snowplow. And, for some reason, they think Tom and Ray will be able to help. Also, a Chevy Venture groans, even in its off hours, a Highlander driver need to bolt her kitchen seat in, and why is a Mini resembling a tossed salad?</description>

<description>An abandoned Nissan takes residence on a Staten Island street--who better to advise on how to get rid of it than Tom and Ray? Also, why a Subaru should not be mistaken for a sardine can, how a Honda magically turned into a Town and Country, and can the words "perfectly safe" be used in the same sentence as "66 MG"?</description>

<description>He&apos;s a med student, good looking, and eats with minimal grunting--so why is Tara in California concerned about her new boyfriend? Could it be that his choice of domicile is an &apos;86 VW van? Also, the fuel line (wallet) flush pitch appears at "Fanny&apos;s Parasol Barbosh", a Nissan owner suffers horn envy, and why would a clutch get depressed at 2,000 feet?</description>
